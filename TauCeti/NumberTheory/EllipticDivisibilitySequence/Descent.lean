# An elliptic net from its two doubling recurrences

`IsEllipticNet W` is a condition on every quadruple of integers, `IsEllipticSequence W` on every
triple. This file proves both equivalent to two families of equations indexed by a *single*
integer — the odd doubling recurrence from `m = 2` on and the even one from `m = 3` on — for a
sequence that is odd, vanishes at `0`, and has `W 1` and `W 2` nonzerodivisors.

The forward direction is `Recurrence.lean`. The reverse is the descent proved here, by
induction on the largest index `a`:

* below `6` there is no valid quadruple at all, four nonnegative same-parity indices in strict
  decrease forcing `6 ≤ a` (`Transfer.lean`);
* above it, a relator on four unconstrained indices is rewritten into relators carrying a fixed
  pair of small indices, by the three-term and ten-term expansions below;
* that reduces to the minimal same-parity pair `(a % 2 + 2, a % 2)`, where either `b + 2 < a`
  admits the transfer down to a smaller first index, or `b + 2 = a` lands on one of the two
  recurrences, chosen by the parity of `a`.

Arbitrary indices are then reduced to a valid quadruple: absolute values make them nonnegative,
coincidences collapse through Mathlib's `atomRel_same` family, and the rest are sorted.

The expansions are polynomial identities in the atoms — `atomRel` is a fixed quadratic
expression in `atom`, so both sides expand to combinations of products of two atoms and `ring`
closes them. No index arithmetic is involved, which is why they need none of the parity
hypotheses that `atom_even`, `atom_odd` and `atomRel_eq` carry.

## Main results

* `isEllipticNet_iff`: the equivalence at **four** indices, and the headline result of the file.
* `isEllipticSequence_iff`: the classical three-index equivalence, its `s = 0` case.
* `IsEllipticNet.of_rel`: the hard direction of the first, with the recurrences in relator
  form.
* `IsEllipticNet.atom_mul_atomRel_eq_of_last_eq_fst`, `…_of_last_eq_snd`,
  `IsEllipticNet.atom_mul_atomRel_eq`: the three-term and ten-term expansions that drive it.

## Implementation notes

The descent itself is private. `AtomRelVanishes` and the three lemmas lowering it are shaped by
this proof rather than by any consumer, and the interface a caller wants is the equivalence and
its hard direction.

Both levels are stated. `isEllipticNet_iff` is the stronger statement and everything is proved
through it, but `IsEllipticSequence` is the predicate Mathlib defines and that
`IsEllipticDvdSequence` is built from, so the three-index equivalence is kept named rather than
left as `(isEllipticNet_iff …).mpr … |>.isEllipticSequence` at each use. The relator-form
`isEllipticSequence_of_rel` is *not* kept: it restated `IsEllipticNet.of_rel` in the spelling
this file uses internally, and had no consumer.

That predicate carries the parity and ordering conditions *inside* it. The induction applies its
hypothesis at quadruples whose validity is not known in advance, so the recursive call has to be
a statement about indices alone.

The antisymmetry of `atomRel` under transpositions is **not** proved here: Mathlib already has
`neg_atomRel₁₂`, `neg_atomRel₂₃` and `neg_atomRel₃₄`, and `SignEquivariance.lean` exports the
general `atomRelFin4_perm` built on them. It is that general form the sorting uses. The net has
no distinguished index — `rel_eq` produces the quadruple `(2p + s, 2q + s, 2r + s, s)`, in which
`s` is free — so all four are sorted, by `Tuple.sort` composed with the reversal, rather than
three against a fixed `0`.

Two parts of the source's apparatus are not needed here, each because Mathlib has absorbed the
layer that made them necessary. Its `rel₄_transf` is `atomRel_avg_sub`; and its minimal-index
definition `if Even a then 0 else 1`, with five `Int.negOnePow` lemmas about it, is `a % 2`,
about which everything needed is `omega`. Its `Tuple.sort` argument over four indices **is**
needed, and is used.

## Provenance

Adapted from D. K. Angdinata's `LutzNagell/EllipticDivisibilitySequence.lean` in AINTLIB
(`github.com/CBirkbeck/AINTLIB`, Apache-2.0, `main` at `1c1c74664e40071c2c2165bc55ca2616a67ccd6b`),
declarations `rel₆_eq₃`, `rel₆_eq₃'`, `rel₆_eq₁₀`, `rel₄_iff_evenRec`, `dMin`, `cMin`,
`Rel₄OfValid`, `rel₄_fix₁_of_fix₂`, `rel₄_of_fix₂`, `rel₄_of_min₂`, `rel₄_of_anti_oddRec_evenRec`,
`rel₄_of_oddRec_evenRec` and `IsEllSequence.of_oddRec_evenRec`. That file's header reads `Authors:
David Kurniadi Angdinata`; following this repository's convention for adapted material the upstream
authorship is credited here rather than in the copyright header. J. Xu is acknowledged for the
surrounding LutzNagell development — he authors `Universal.lean` and co-authors
`DivisionPolynomialOmega.lean` at the same revision — as context for this port, not as an author of
the declarations above.

The four-index sorting and the net entry point adapt two further declarations of that same file,
`IsEllSequence.rel₄` and `IsEllSequence.net`.

The source states its expansions against its own `addMulSub` and `rel₄`, which Mathlib now
supplies as `atom` and `atomRel` with the same definitions, so those statements transfer by
renaming. Three of its declarations are deliberately **not** ported. Its `rel₆` abbreviation for
`addMulSub W k l * rel₄ W a b c d`, with the `@[simp]` lemma unfolding it, names a product
rather than a concept and exists only to shorten four statements, so it would stand a second
public spelling of `atom _ _ * atomRel _ _ _ _`; the statements below write the product out.
Its `addMulSub_sq_mul_rel₄_eq₉`, the nine-term expansion, is unused in the source itself — it
occurs there only at its own declaration — and this descent does not need it. Its swap family
`rel₄_swap₀₁`, `rel₄_swap₁₂`, `rel₄_swap₂₃` is Mathlib's `neg_atomRel₁₂ … neg_atomRel₃₄`, which
carry the negation on the other side, and the `relFin4_perm` built on it is already in this
repository as `SignEquivariance.lean`, and is used from there.

`rel₄_iff_evenRec` is the one source declaration carrying `set_option allowUnsafeReducibility
true` together with `attribute [local reducible] Nat.rawCast`, which #2860 declined to bring
into this repository. Stating the base cases with indices in `2 * _` and `2 * _ + 1` form lets
`atomRel_two_mul` and `atom_odd` apply directly, so neither the option nor the attribute
appears here.

`(a', b, c₀, d₀)` with `a' ≤ a`, the relator vanishes at `(a, b, c, c₀)` outright, and at
`(a, b, c, d₀)` once `c₀ < c`. Both follow from a three-term expansion trading the relator's

/-- **Being an elliptic net is exactly satisfying the two doubling recurrences.** For a sequence
that is odd, vanishes at `0` and has `W 1`, `W 2` nonzerodivisors, the **four**-index relation at
every quadruple is equivalent to the odd recurrence from `m = 2` and the even one from `m = 3` —
finitely many equations per index rather than a condition on quadruples.

Under these hypotheses, therefore, being an elliptic net and being an elliptic sequence are the
same condition. They are not the same condition in general: `normEDS b c d` at arbitrary
parameters need not have `W 2 = b` a nonzerodivisor, and `NormEDS.lean` obtains the net there
without this equivalence. -/
