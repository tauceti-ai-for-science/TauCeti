# Basic instances for the `p`-adic numbers

This file provides a direct instance for the nontriviality of `ℚ_[p]`, already implied by
its field structure, and an instance expressing that `2` is invertible. These instances support
finite-dimensional constructions and algebraic trace and norm calculations over the `p`-adic field.
