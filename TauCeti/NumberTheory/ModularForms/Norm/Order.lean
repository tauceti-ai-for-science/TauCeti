# Orders along the norm map

The general-level valence formula reads the level-one formula off the norm
`ModularForm.norm`, so it needs the orders of a form to distribute over the norm's coset
product. This file records that distribution at interior points, for a form on any subgroup
of finite relative index: each coset factor is nonzero when the form is, and the vanishing
order of the norm is the sum of the orders of the factors.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.SlashInvariantForm.quotientFunc_ne_zero`: a coset factor of the norm of a nonzero
  form is nonzero.
* `TauCeti.ModularForm.orderOfVanishingAt_norm`: the vanishing order of the norm at a point
  is the sum, over the coset space, of the vanishing orders of the coset factors.
* `TauCeti.ModularForm.orderOfVanishingAt_quotientFunc_le_orderOfVanishingAt_norm`: each coset
  factor vanishes to at most the order the norm does, with
  `TauCeti.ModularForm.orderOfVanishingAt_le_orderOfVanishingAt_norm` as the identity-coset
  corollary — so the zeros of the norm dominate those of the form.
* `TauCeti.ModularForm.finite_image_orbit_mk_setOf_orderOfVanishingAt_ne_zero_subgroup`: the
  consumer of that domination — at any level of finite relative index in `𝒮ℒ`, the image in
  `𝒢 \ ℍ` of the points at which a form has nonzero vanishing order is finite. Equivalently,
  those points meet only finitely many `𝒢`-orbits.

## References

* The two-step route used here — order domination under the norm carries the support into the
  finite support of the level-one norm, and finite index makes the fibres of the orbit comparison
  finite — was arrived at independently of, and concurrently with,
  [PR #3330](https://github.com/TauCetiProject/TauCeti/pull/3330), which gives the same argument
  for a subgroup of `SL(2, ℤ)` of finite index. That work has since landed; nothing here depends
  on it, and the two remain independent derivations rather than one building on the other.

  The statements differ in the group: this one takes `𝒢 ≤ GL (Fin 2) ℝ` of finite *relative* index
  in `𝒮ℒ`, which **need not lie inside `𝒮ℒ`**. That is also why the order is not descended to the
  quotient here — `𝒢` may contain elements of negative determinant, under which the vanishing
  order is not known to be invariant (`orderOfVanishingAt_smul` asks for `0 < det`) — so only the
  image of the nonzero-order set in `𝒢 \ ℍ` is claimed, not an order function on it.
