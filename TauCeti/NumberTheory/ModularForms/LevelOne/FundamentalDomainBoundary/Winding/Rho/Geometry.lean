# Distance of the boundary contour from `ρ`

The geometry of the shifted contour `t ↦ fdBoundary H t - ρ` about the corner `ρ` at
parameter `t = 3`: the chord distance along the arc, the purely imaginary linear form
along the left vertical, the norm lower bounds on the far pieces, the slit-plane
confinement of every piece, and the exact polar forms and principal logarithms of the
shifted contour beside the corner. The corner joins the arc to the vertical at the
interior angle `π/3`, which is exactly the gap between the two one-sided argument limits
`π/6` and `π/2` — the source of the winding value `-1/6` at `ρ`.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.ModularForm.norm_fdBoundary_sub_rho_arc` (the chord distance).
* `TauCeti.ModularForm.fdBoundary_sub_rho_of_mem_Icc_three_four` (the linear form).
* `TauCeti.ModularForm.log_fdBoundary_three_sub_sub_rho`,
  `TauCeti.ModularForm.log_fdBoundary_three_add_sub_rho` (the endpoint logarithms).
