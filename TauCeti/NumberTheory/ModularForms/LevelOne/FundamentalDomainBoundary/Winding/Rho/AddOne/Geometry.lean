# Distance of the boundary contour from `ρ + 1`

The geometry of the shifted contour `t ↦ fdBoundary H t - (ρ + 1)` about the corner
`ρ + 1` at parameter `t = 1`: the purely imaginary linear form along the right vertical,
the chord distance along the arc, the norm lower bounds on the far pieces, the
closed-upper-half-plane confinement — and the exact endpoint logarithms beside the corner.

The confinement holds only once the ceiling clears the corner row, and the confinement
results accordingly carry `√3/2 ≤ H`. Under that hypothesis the shifted contour touches the
branch cut at `t = 3`, where its value is `-1`, but never crosses it; at the degenerate
height `H = √3/2` the whole left vertical degenerates to that point and lies on the cut
throughout. Below the corner row the claim fails outright: on the left vertical the shifted
contour is `-1 + (t - 3)(H - √3/2)i`, so for `H < √3/2` the imaginary part is negative
immediately after `t = 3` and the contour does cross the cut.

The corner joins the vertical to the arc at the interior
angle `π/3`, which is exactly the gap between the one-sided argument limits `π/2` and
`5π/6` — the source of the winding value `-1/6` at `ρ + 1`.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.ModularForm.rho_add_one_im` (the corner shares the row `Im = √3/2` with `ρ`).
* `TauCeti.ModularForm.fdBoundary_sub_rho_add_one_of_mem_Icc_zero_one` (the linear form).
* `TauCeti.ModularForm.norm_fdBoundary_sub_rho_add_one_arc` (the chord distance) and
  `TauCeti.ModularForm.norm_fdBoundary_sub_rho_add_one_arc_le` (its monotonicity in the
  angular gap).

`ρ`-shift, so its real part is constantly `-1` and it runs alongside the branch cut. Where the
ceiling misses the corner row the imaginary part vanishes only at `t = 3`, so the cut is met
there alone — above it when the ceiling clears the row, below it otherwise. At the degenerate
height `H = √3/2` the imaginary part vanishes identically and the whole segment is the point
`-1`, lying on the cut throughout. -/
