# Winding of the boundary contour at the open unit arc

A point `w` of the open unit arc is `fdBoundary H t₀` for a unique `t₀ ∈ (1, 3)`; the arc is
one smooth circle parameterization through `t = 2`, so no corner is in the way even at `i`,
and the winding number at every open-arc point is `-1/2`. The adapted branch
(`Winding/NonCorner/Basic.lean`) is `c = w⁻¹`, whose cut ray `{r·w : r ≤ 1}` runs from `w`
through the open unit disc and leaves through the lower half-plane, missing the rest of the
contour. The chord distance is `2·sin(|t - t₀|·π/12)`, uniform along the arc; the excised
integral is `-π·i - 2·arcsin(ε/2)·i`, and the limit is `-π·i`.

The statements cover the whole open arc, including `i`: a consumer wanting the value there
supplies the elliptic point's three elementary facts — `‖i‖ = 1`, `|re i| = 0 < 1/2`,
`0 < im i` — directly to the theorems below.

The polar computations below restate angle and cast algebra as inline `show _ by ring` /
`show _ by push_cast; ring` equations: each aims the expression at the exact spelling the
next `Real.cos`/`Complex.exp`/`Complex.log` rewrite matches.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.ModularForm.hasCauchyPVAt_fdBoundary_arc`,
  `TauCeti.ModularForm.windingNumber_fdBoundary_arc`: the principal value `-πi` and the
  winding number `-1/2` at a point of the open unit arc.

The hypotheses are spelled the way the singular-set interface provides them
(`TauCeti.ModularForm.arcSingularSet`): an arc point carries `‖w‖ = 1`, `|w.re| < 2⁻¹` and
`0 < w.im`. The theorems also assume `1 < H`, which makes the contour the boundary of a
genuine truncation: the ceiling then clears the arc point by `H - 1 > 0`.

  `2baa76f742bdb4fb8ee323fabba41203bd390e08`, Apache-2.0, Chris Birkbeck) — the statement
  pair fills the arc role of that project's `FDWindingDataFull.boundary_winding`, whose arc
  input is the FTC-provider file `ForMathlib/ArcGenericFTCProvider.lean`. The proof route is

/-! ## The arc

A point `w` of the open unit arc is `fdBoundary H t₀` for a unique `t₀ ∈ (1, 3)`; the arc is
one smooth circle parameterization through `t = 2`, so no corner is in the way even at `i`.
The adapted branch is `c = w⁻¹`, whose cut ray `{r·w : r ≤ 1}` runs from `w` through the
open unit disc and leaves through the lower half-plane, missing the rest of the contour. The
chord distance is `2·sin(|t - t₀|·π/12)`, uniform along the arc.

The polar computations below restate angle and cast algebra as inline `show _ by ring` /
`show _ by push_cast; ring` equations: each aims the expression at the exact spelling the
next `Real.cos`/`Complex.exp`/`Complex.log` rewrite matches.
