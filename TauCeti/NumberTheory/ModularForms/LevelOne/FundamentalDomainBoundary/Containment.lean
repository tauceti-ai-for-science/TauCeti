# The boundary contour lies in the truncated fundamental domain

The valence-formula contour `fdBoundary H` traces the boundary of the truncated fundamental
domain, so every point of it lies in that domain's closure. This file records that containment
and the four coordinate estimates it rests on — a height bound above and below, a bound on the
real part, and the lower bound on the modulus.

These are statements about the contour's *geometry* alone. They are separated from the winding
theory that first needed them so that consumers wanting only the containment — the excised
integrability criterion, for instance — need not import winding numbers.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.ModularForm.fdBoundary_mem_coe_truncatedFundamentalDomain`: the contour lies in the
  closed truncated fundamental domain.
* `TauCeti.ModularForm.sqrt_three_div_two_lt_one`: the corner height lies below the apex.
* `TauCeti.ModularForm.sqrt_three_div_two_le_im_fdBoundary`, `…im_fdBoundary_le`,
  `…abs_re_fdBoundary_le_half`, `…one_le_norm_fdBoundary`: the four coordinate estimates.

## References

The contour geometry follows the fundamental-domain boundary development of AINTLIB's
`LeanModularForms` (`ForMathlib/FDBoundary.lean`, `FDBoundaryH.lean`, `FDBoundaryPath.lean`),
ported onto the current Mathlib pin; these declarations were first written in Tau Ceti's
`Winding/Basic.lean` and are collected here so that consumers needing only the containment do
not import winding theory.
