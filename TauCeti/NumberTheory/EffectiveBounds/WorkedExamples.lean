# Worked examples: the effective bounds on the named quadratic fields

The effective-bounds roadmap keeps its estimates honest with two arithmetic worked examples,
each asking that a general bound be exercised on a *named* number field rather than a
same-shape analogue:

* the discriminant bound recovers `|d_{ℚ(i)}| = 4` from the integral basis `{1, i}`;
* the class-number bound is non-vacuous on `ℚ(√-5)`, giving `h ≤ 64·5`.

This file realises both worked examples on concrete `NumberField` instances, each exercising
the repo's own effective-bound machinery rather than citing a closed formula from Mathlib.

For `ℚ(√-5)` we take `AdjoinRoot (X² + 5)` over `ℚ` (a field because `X² + 5` is irreducible,
having no rational root), a degree-two number field with a square root of `-5`, and feed it to
`NumberField.classNumber_le_natAbs_of_sq_intCast`.

For `ℚ(i)` we take the fourth cyclotomic field `CyclotomicField 4 ℚ`, whose primitive fourth
root of unity `ζ` satisfies `ζ² = -1` and generates `ℚ(i)`. The pair `{1, ζ}` is a `ℤ`-basis
of the ring of integers (Mathlib's integral power basis of a cyclotomic `𝒪_K`), so the repo's
equality companion of the discriminant bound
(`NumberField.discr_eq_of_basis_isIntegral_of_span_eq_top_of_discr_eq_int`) turns the
trace-form evaluation `disc ℚ {1, ζ} = 4·(-1) = -4`
(`TauCeti.Algebra.discr_one_elem_eq_of_sq_algebraMap`) into `d_{ℚ(i)} = -4` exactly, whence
`|d_{ℚ(i)}| = 4`.

## Main results

* `NumberField.WorkedExamples.classNumber_adjoinRoot_sqrt_neg_five_le`: `h ≤ 320` for
  `ℚ(√-5)`.
* `NumberField.WorkedExamples.discr_cyclotomicField_four`: `d_{ℚ(i)} = -4`.
* `NumberField.WorkedExamples.abs_discr_cyclotomicField_four`: `|d_{ℚ(i)}| = 4`.
* `NumberField.WorkedExamples.natAbs_discr_cyclotomicField_four`: `|d_{ℚ(i)}| = 4`.

## Provenance

No formal code is vendored. The effective bounds consumed here (`classNumber_le_bound`, the
quadratic class-number corollary, the discriminant-equality companion, and the square-root
trace-form diagonalisation) carry their own attribution to `kim-em/erdos-unit-distance`; the
`NumberField` constructions for `ℚ(√-5)` and `ℚ(i)` and the arithmetic specialisations are new.
