# The ramified primes of an imaginary quadratic field span exactly `2 ^ (t - 1)` classes

Let `K = ℚ(√d)` be an imaginary quadratic field, presented by `θ : 𝓞 K` with
`minpoly ℤ θ = X ^ 2 - d` for a squarefree `d < -1`, and let `t` be the number of rational primes
ramifying in `K`. The classes `[𝔭_p]` of the primes above the ramified primes are `2`-torsion
(`NumberField.classGroupMk0_sq_eq_one_of_mem_ramifiedPrimes`) and satisfy the relation
`∏_{p ∣ d} [𝔭_p] = 1` (`prod_classGroupMk0_eq_one`), which bounds the subgroup they generate by
`2 ^ (t - 1)` elements (`natCard_closure_image_classGroupMk0_le`). This file supplies the matching
lower bound, so that subgroup has **exactly** `2 ^ (t - 1)` elements, and reads off the
genus-theoretic lower bound `2-rank Cl(K) ≥ t - 1`.

The content is that there is no relation beyond the known one. A relation is a subset `S` of the
ramified primes with `∏_{p ∈ S} 𝔭_p` principal; taking absolute norms, a generator `z` of that
product has `|N(z)| = ∏_{p ∈ S} p`, and since `d < 0` the norm form of `K` is positive definite,
so `N(z) = ∏_{p ∈ S} p` on the nose. Writing `n = |d|`, the norm form is `(A² + n B²)/4` in
general and `A² + n B²` when `d ≢ 1 (mod 4)` (`NumberField.exists_sq_sub_mul_sq_eq_four_mul_norm`
and `NumberField.exists_sq_sub_mul_sq_eq_norm_of_mod_four_ne_one`). The product `m = ∏_{p ∈ S} p`
is a squarefree divisor of the discriminant, hence of `n` when `d ≡ 1 (mod 4)` (where `disc K = d`
is odd) and of `2n` otherwise (where `disc K = 4d`). Positive definiteness then leaves very little
room: if the `B`-coordinate vanishes, `m` is a square and so `m = 1`; if it does not, then
`m ≥ n/4` resp. `m ≥ n`, and the few surviving ratios `n/m` are excluded one by one. The upshot is
`m = 1` or `m = n`, that is, `S = ∅` or `S` is the set of prime factors of `d`.

Counting is then immediate: fix a prime factor `q` of `d`. If two subsets of the ramified primes
avoiding `q` have the same product of classes, their symmetric difference is a relation, and it
too avoids `q`; so it is not the set of prime factors of `d`, which contains `q`, leaving only the
empty relation — that is, the two subsets are equal. Distinct such subsets therefore have distinct
products of classes.

The radicand `d = -1` is genuinely excluded, not merely for convenience: there `t = 1` and the
single ramified prime `2` has the *principal* prime `(1 + i)` above it, so the relation used here
(which lives on the prime factors of `d`) is empty while the classes still collapse. The bound
`2-rank ≥ t - 1 = 0` is vacuous in that case anyway.

For the ordinary class group of a *real* quadratic field the analogous statement is false — `ℚ(√3)`
has `t = 2` and class number `1` — which is why genus theory states the `t - 1` formula for the
narrow class group there; only the imaginary case, where narrow and ordinary agree, is treated
here.

The classical source is D. A. Cox, *Primes of the Form x² + ny²*, §6.A, and F. Lemmermeyer,
*Reciprocity Laws: From Euler to Eisenstein*, §2.2, where this is the lower-bound half of the
ambiguous class number formula.

## Main results

In the namespace `TauCeti.Multiquadratic`:

* `prod_eq_one_or_prod_eq_natAbs_of_isPrincipal_prod`: a principal product of ramified primes has
  `∏_{p ∈ s} p` equal to `1` or to `|d|`.
* `eq_empty_or_eq_primeFactors_of_prod_classGroupMk0_eq_one`: the class-group form — a trivial
  product of ramified-prime classes is indexed by `∅` or by the prime factors of `d`.
* `two_pow_le_natCard_closure_image_classGroupMk0` and `natCard_closure_image_classGroupMk0_eq`:
  the classes of the ramified primes generate a subgroup of order exactly `2 ^ (t - 1)`.
* `card_sub_one_le_twoRank` and `ncard_ramifiedPrimes_sub_one_le_twoRank`: hence
  `2-rank Cl(𝓞 K) ≥ t - 1`.

/-- **The only principal products of ramified primes are the two obvious ones.** Let `K = ℚ(√d)`
be an imaginary quadratic field with `d < -1` squarefree, and let `s` be a finite set of ramified
rational primes with `P p` the prime of `𝓞 K` above `p ∈ s`. If `∏_{p ∈ s} 𝔭_p` is principal, then
`∏_{p ∈ s} p` is `1` (forcing `s = ∅`) or `|d|` (the known relation
`span_singleton_eq_prod_primeFactors`, which comes from `θ` itself).

This is the arithmetic heart of the genus-theoretic `2`-rank formula: the classes of the ramified
primes satisfy no relation beyond the one already known. The proof takes absolute norms — a
generator `z` of the product has `|N(z)| = ∏_{p ∈ s} p` — and then reads off the possibilities
from the norm form of `K`, which is positive definite because `d < 0`. Whether the `2` in the
discriminant is available as a ramified prime is exactly the `d mod 4` split: for `d ≡ 1 (mod 4)`
the norm form is `(A² + |d|B²)/4` and `∏_{p ∈ s} p` divides `|d|`, while otherwise the form is
`A² + |d|B²` and the product divides `2|d|`. -/
