# Summability at `s = 1` of a logarithmically damped Dirichlet series

A Dirichlet series whose coefficients have `O(t log t)` partial sums need not converge on the line
`Re s = 1`, but it does converge there once each coefficient is weighted by a factor of size
`O((1 + log n) ^ (-3))`: in the Abel-summation bound
`TauCeti.summable_div_mul_one_add_log_cube`, one of the three logarithms absorbs the `log t` in the
growth of the partial sums, and the remaining two leave the integrable majorant
`(t (1 + log t) ^ 2)⁻¹`.

Such a weight arises whenever a Dirichlet series is tested against a smooth compactly supported
function, whose Fourier transform decays faster than every power.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.LSeries.LSeriesSummable_mul_of_norm_le`: an `O((1 + log n) ^ (-3))` weighting of
  coefficients with `O(t log t)` partial sums has a Dirichlet series converging at `s = 1`.
