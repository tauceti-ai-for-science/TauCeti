# A growth bound for nonnegative coefficients, and the summability it supplies

The smoothed Wiener--Ikehara asymptotic
`TauCeti.LSeries.tendsto_tsum_term_mul_fourier_atTop` still carries a summability hypothesis: the
Fourier-weighted series `∑ a n 𝓕 psi (log (n / x) / 2π) / n` has to converge on the boundary line
`Re s = 1`, where the coefficients are no longer damped by `n ^ (-(sigma - 1))`. This file removes
that hypothesis for nonnegative coefficients, which is the only case Wiener--Ikehara is about.

The input is coefficient nonnegativity together with the boundary remainder data on the real
segment `sigma ∈ (1, 2]`; the growth bound for the partial sums is derived from them, not assumed.
Nonnegativity turns the boundary data into the one-sided estimate
`∑ ‖a n‖ / n ^ sigma ≤ B / (sigma - 1)` on `(1, 2]`, and inserting
`sigma = 1 + 1 / log t` into it bounds `∑_{n ≤ t} ‖a n‖` by a multiple of `t log t`. That is weaker
than the Chebyshev bound `O(t)` which Wiener--Ikehara ultimately proves, but it is available before
any Tauberian argument, and one logarithm to spare is all the summability needs: the Fourier
transform of a smooth compactly supported function decays faster than `|v| ^ (-3)`, so the factor
attached to `a n` is `O((log n) ^ (-3))`, and the Abel-summation bound
`TauCeti.LSeries.LSeriesSummable_mul_of_norm_le` converts `O(t log t)` partial sums into a
convergent series.

Only the values of the boundary remainder on the real segment `sigma ∈ (1, 2]` enter the growth
bound, so the results below are stated with the boundary data restricted to that segment; the final
asymptotic specializes the half-plane hypotheses it inherits from
`TauCeti.LSeries.tendsto_tsum_term_mul_fourier_atTop_of_contDiff`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.LSeries.tsum_norm_term_le_of_boundary`: nonnegative coefficients with a boundary
  remainder continuous on the segment `[1, 2]` have a convergent norm series with
  `∑ ‖term a sigma n‖ ≤ B / (sigma - 1)` on `(1, 2]`.
* `TauCeti.LSeries.isBigO_sum_Icc_norm_of_boundary`: the resulting `O(t log t)` bound for the
  partial sums.
* `TauCeti.LSeries.LSeriesSummable_mul_fourier_of_nonneg`: the Fourier weight is small enough for
  that bound to force summability at `s = 1`, at every scale `x > 0`.
* `TauCeti.LSeries.tendsto_tsum_term_mul_fourier_atTop_of_nonneg`: **the smoothed Wiener--Ikehara
  asymptotic for nonnegative coefficients**, with no summability hypothesis left.

/-! ### The one-sided bound coming from the boundary data -/

/-- For nonnegative coefficients, a boundary remainder `G` continuous on the real segment `[1, 2]`
bounds the Dirichlet series on `(1, 2]` by `B / (sigma - 1)`: the remainder is bounded on the
compact segment, and the pole term contributes `‖A‖ / (sigma - 1)`.

No analytic continuation is used, only the values of `G` on that segment and the identity
`G = LSeries a - A / (s - 1)` on its interior. -/

/-! ### The partial-sum bound -/

/-- **A crude growth bound for the partial sums.** Nonnegative coefficients whose Dirichlet series
has a boundary remainder continuous on the segment `[1, 2]` satisfy
`∑_{1 ≤ n ≤ t} ‖a n‖ = O(t log t)`.

The proof inserts `sigma = 1 + 1 / log t` into `tsum_norm_term_le_of_boundary`: the truncation
`n ≤ t` costs a factor `t ^ sigma = e t`, and the bound `B / (sigma - 1)` is `B log t`. This is one
logarithm short of the Chebyshev bound `O(t)` that Wiener--Ikehara eventually delivers, but it
needs no Tauberian input. -/

/-- **The smoothed Wiener--Ikehara asymptotic for nonnegative coefficients.** Testing the Dirichlet
