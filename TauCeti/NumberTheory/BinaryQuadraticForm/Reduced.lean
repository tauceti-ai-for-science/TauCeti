# Reduced binary quadratic forms

An integral binary quadratic form `a x² + b x y + c y²` is **reduced** when `|b| ≤ a ≤ c`, and
`0 ≤ b` whenever `|b| = a` or `a = c` (Cohen, Definition 5.3.2). Every positive-definite form is
`SL₂(ℤ)`-equivalent to exactly one reduced form, the boundary conditions being what removes the
double count on the edges of the fundamental domain. This file defines the predicate and, for
`D ≠ 0`, the finite set of reduced forms of discriminant `-D`: a reduced form of discriminant
`-D < 0` has `|b| ≤ a ≤ √(D / 3)` and `c ≤ D / 3`, so the set is a filter of an explicit box and is
decidable. Weighted, it counts the Hurwitz class number `TauCeti.hurwitzClassNumber`.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.IsReducedForm f`: the form `f = a x² + b x y + c y²` is reduced.
* `TauCeti.reducedForms D`: for `D ≠ 0`, the finite set of reduced forms of discriminant `-D`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.mem_reducedForms`: for `D ≠ 0`, `f ∈ reducedForms D` exactly when `f.discrim = -D` and
  `f` is reduced, so the box the definition searches is no restriction.
* `TauCeti.reducedForms_eq_empty_of_mod_four_eq_one_or_two`: there are no reduced forms of
  discriminant `-D` when `D ≡ 1, 2 (mod 4)`, since a discriminant `b² - 4 a c` is `0` or `1`
  modulo `4` (`Int.discrim_emod_four`).

## Implementation notes

The definitions are exposed, so that the kernel can evaluate `reducedForms D`, as `decide` does for
the values of `TauCeti.hurwitzClassNumber`.

/-- The integral binary quadratic form `f = a x² + b x y + c y²` is **reduced**: `|b| ≤ a ≤ c`,
and `0 ≤ b` whenever `|b| = a` or `a = c` (Cohen, Definition 5.3.2).

For a positive-definite form this picks exactly one representative of each `SL₂(ℤ)`-class: the
inequalities place the root `τ = (-b + i √(4 a c - b²)) / (2 a)` of `a τ² + b τ + c` in
`ModularGroup.fd`, and the sign condition chooses one of each pair of boundary points that `SL₂(ℤ)`
identifies. Definiteness is not part of the predicate (`IsReducedForm ⟨0, 0, 1⟩` holds), but a
reduced form with `f.discrim < 0` has `0 < f.a` (`pos_of_nonneg_of_discrim_lt_zero`). -/

/-- The reduced forms `a x² + b x y + c y²` of discriminant `b² - 4 a c = -D`.

The definition searches the box `1 ≤ a ≤ √(D / 3)`, `|b| ≤ √(D / 3)`, `1 ≤ c ≤ D / 3` (with
`Nat.sqrt`), which makes it a finite, decidable set; `mem_reducedForms` shows that for `D ≠ 0` this
box loses nothing. For `D = 0` the box is empty, so `reducedForms 0 = ∅`, although every `c y²`
with `0 ≤ c` is a reduced form of discriminant `0`. -/
