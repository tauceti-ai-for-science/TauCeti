# The discriminant of a number field from an integral basis

If `b` is (the image in `K` of) a `ℤ`-basis of the ring of integers `𝒪_K` — an *integral
basis* — then its rational trace-form discriminant is exactly the field discriminant,

`disc b = d_K` (over `ℚ`).

More usefully, this holds for any `ℚ`-basis `b` of `K` consisting of algebraic integers whose
`ℤ`-span inside `𝒪_K` is everything: exhibiting such a spanning integral basis and evaluating
its discriminant computes `d_K` on the nose. This is the exact-attainment half of the effective
discriminant bound `|d_K| ≤ |disc b|`
(`NumberField.abs_discr_le_of_basis_isIntegral`), which is strict exactly when the span
has index `m > 1` (then `disc b = m² · d_K`). It also drives concrete discriminant computations,
e.g. `{1, i}` is a `ℤ`-basis of the Gaussian integers and `disc {1, i} = -4` gives `d_{ℚ(i)} = -4`.

## Main results

* `NumberField.discr_eq_of_integralBasis`: for a `ℤ`-basis `c` of `𝒪_K`, the rational
  discriminant of its image in `K` equals `d_K`.
* `NumberField.discr_eq_of_basis_isIntegral_of_span_eq_top`: the same, phrased for a
  `ℚ`-basis `b` of algebraic integers whose `ℤ`-span (inside `𝒪_K`) is everything.
* `NumberField.abs_discr_eq_of_basis_isIntegral_of_span_eq_top`: the matching
  `|d_K| = |disc b|`, the equality companion of `abs_discr_le_of_basis_isIntegral`.
* `NumberField.discr_eq_of_basis_isIntegral_of_span_eq_top_of_discr_eq_int`: the consumer
  form that turns an evaluated integer basis discriminant into `d_K` exactly, with
  `NumberField.natAbs_discr_eq_of_basis_isIntegral_of_span_eq_top_of_discr_eq_int` its
  `natAbs` corollary.

## Provenance

No formal code is vendored. The equality is assembled from Mathlib's
`Algebra.discr_localizationLocalization` and `NumberField.discr_eq_discr`; the `ℚ`-basis form
constructs the `ℤ`-basis of `𝒪_K` from the spanning hypothesis. It is the exact-attainment
companion of the migrated Layer-1 bound `NumberField.abs_discr_le_of_basis_isIntegral`,
whose source attribution (kim-em/erdos-unit-distance) is in
`TauCeti/NumberTheory/EffectiveBounds/Discriminant/Basic.lean`.
