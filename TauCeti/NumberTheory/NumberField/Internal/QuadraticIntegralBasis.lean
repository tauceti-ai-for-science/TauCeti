# The `{1, x}` rational basis of algebraic integers in a quadratic number field

Internal helper: in a quadratic number field `K`, an integral element `x` that is not rational
packages the pair `{1, x}` as a `ℚ`-basis of `K` whose two vectors are algebraic integers. It is
*not* claimed to be a `ℤ`-basis of the full ring of integers `𝓞 K`. This construction is shared by
the effective discriminant bound `NumberField.abs_discr_le_of_sq_intCast` and the
roadmap's `ℚ(i)` discriminant worked example, so it lives in the generic `NumberField.Internal`
namespace rather than being duplicated inline or exposed from either headline API file.
