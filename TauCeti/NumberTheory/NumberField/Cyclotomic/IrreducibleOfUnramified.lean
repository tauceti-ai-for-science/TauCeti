# Unramifiedness makes the cyclotomic polynomial irreducible over a number field

Let `K` be a number field and `p` a prime that is unramified in `K`. Then the cyclotomic polynomial
`Φ_{p^(k+1)}` is irreducible over `K` for every `k`; in particular `Φ_p` is, so
`[K(ζ_p) : K] = p - 1`. For the Galois group itself, feed that irreducibility to Mathlib's
`IsCyclotomicExtension.autEquivPow`, which yields `Gal(K(ζ_p)/K) ≃* (ZMod p)ˣ`; this file proves
irreducibility and the ramification behind it, and does not restate that consequence.

The mechanism is ramification, not an intersection of fields. Let `F / K` be a `p^(k+1)`-th
cyclotomic extension and `𝔔` a prime of `𝓞 F` above `p`. Inside `F` the subfield `ℚ(ζ)` is the
`p^(k+1)`-th cyclotomic field over `ℚ`, in which `p` is totally ramified with index
`φ(p^(k+1))`; ramification indices multiply in towers, so `e(𝔔 / p) ≥ φ(p^(k+1))`. On the other
hand `e(𝔔 / p) = e(𝔔 / 𝔮) · e(𝔮 / p)` with `𝔮 = 𝔔 ∩ 𝓞 K`, and `e(𝔮 / p) = 1` because `p` is
unramified in `K`. Hence `e(𝔔 / 𝔮) ≥ φ(p^(k+1))`, while `e(𝔔 / 𝔮) ≤ [F : K]`. So
`[F : K] ≥ φ(p^(k+1))`, which is irreducibility of `Φ_{p^(k+1)}` over `K` by
`IsCyclotomicExtension.irreducible_cyclotomic_of_totient_le_finrank`.

The intersection `L ⊓ K(ζ_p) = ⊥` for an extension `L / K` gives none of this: it constrains `L`,
whereas `[K(ζ_p) : K]` is a proper divisor of `p - 1` exactly when `K ∩ ℚ(ζ_p) ≠ ℚ`. The witness
`K = ℚ(√5)`, `p = 5` is `Polynomial.not_irreducible_cyclotomic_five_of_sq_eq_five`.

## Main results

* `IsPrimitiveRoot.totient_le_ramificationIdx`: a primitive `p^(k+1)`-th root of unity in a
  number field `F` forces `φ(p^(k+1)) ≤ e(𝔔 ∣ ℤ)` for every prime `𝔔` of `𝓞 F` above `p`.
* `IsCyclotomicExtension.totient_le_finrank_of_unramified`: `φ(p^(k+1)) ≤ [F : K]` when `p` is
  unramified in `K`.
* `IsCyclotomicExtension.ramificationIdx_eq_totient`: every prime of `𝓞 F` above `p` has
  ramification index exactly `φ(p^(k+1))` over `𝓞 K`, so `F / K` is totally ramified there.
* `IsCyclotomicExtension.inf_eq_bot_prime_pow_of_unramified`: for intermediate fields `A` and `B`
  of `Ω / K` with `B` a `p^(k+1)`-th cyclotomic extension, `p` unramified in `A` gives
  `A ⊓ B = ⊥`.
* `IsCyclotomicExtension.inf_eq_bot_of_unramified`: the prime case.
* `IsCyclotomicExtension.irreducible_cyclotomic_prime_pow_of_unramified`: `Φ_{p^(k+1)}` is
  irreducible over `K` when `p` is unramified in `K`.
* `IsCyclotomicExtension.irreducible_cyclotomic_of_unramified`: the prime case.

## References

Unramifiedness, rather than an intersection of fields, is what gives the full cyclotomic degree.

Total ramification of `ℚ(ζ_{p^r})` at `p` is Milne, *Algebraic Number Theory*, Proposition 6.2,
and Sharifi, *Algebraic Number Theory*, Lemma 3.1.13; the ramification bookkeeping is Sharifi,
Remark 2.5.7 and Theorem 2.5.11. The argument mirrors
`TauCeti.Multiquadratic.ramificationIdx_eq_two_of_liesOver_primeDiscriminantPrime`.

The tower and discriminant bookkeeping was mined from the private declarations
`prime_dvd_natAbs_discr_cyclotomic_dvd` and `cyclotomicField_finrank_eq` in
`CebotarevDensity/Abelian.lean` of
[CBirkbeck/chebotarev-density](https://github.com/CBirkbeck/chebotarev-density) (Apache-2.0,
Birkbeck--Brasca) at commit `8575c9df1ae0a61120ab5c964c7911414254bec7`. The source states those
through coprimality to the discriminant; the results here are restated through unramifiedness.

/-- **A cyclotomic extension is totally ramified above an unramified prime.** If `p` is unramified
in `K`, every prime `𝔔` of `𝓞 F` above `p` has ramification index exactly `φ(p^(k+1))` over
`𝓞 K` — which by `totient_le_finrank_of_unramified` is the full degree `[F : K]`, so there is a
single prime above `p` and it is totally ramified.

The three bounds `φ ≤ e(𝔔) ≤ [F : K] ≤ φ` collapse to equalities: the first is the tower
computation, the second the fundamental identity `∑ eᵢ fᵢ = [F : K]`, and the third holds for any
cyclotomic extension. This is the form the intersection argument consumes, where the lower bound
alone is not enough.

/-- **A cyclotomic extension of full degree meets an unramified extension trivially.** For `A` and
`B` intermediate fields of `Ω / K` with `B` a `p^(k+1)`-th cyclotomic extension of full degree
`φ(p^(k+1))`, if `p` is unramified in `A` then `A ⊓ B = ⊥`.

`B / K` is totally ramified above `p` by `ramificationIdx_eq_totient`, while `A`, and hence
`A ⊓ B`, is unramified there; multiplicativity in the tower hands the whole of `φ(p^(k+1))` to
`B / (A ⊓ B)`, and a ramification index never exceeds a degree, so `A ⊓ B` has degree one
over `K`.

The degree `[B : K] = φ(p^(k+1))` is **derived, not assumed**: unramifiedness already pins the
ramification index at `φ(p^(k+1))` via `ramificationIdx_eq_totient`, and a ramification index never
exceeds the degree while a cyclotomic degree never exceeds `φ`, so the two bounds meet. Requiring
the degree as a hypothesis would have been redundant, and would have pushed onto every caller a
fact this theorem's own hypotheses already give.

This stays independent of `irreducible_cyclotomic_prime_pow_of_unramified` below: the degree comes
from the ramification count, not from irreducibility of `Φ_{p^(k+1)}`, so there is no circularity.
Specialised to `K = ℚ` it says a number field unramified at `p` meets `ℚ(ζ_{p^(k+1)})` trivially;
specialised to a general base it is the corresponding statement about `L ∩ K(ζ_{p^(k+1)})`. -/
