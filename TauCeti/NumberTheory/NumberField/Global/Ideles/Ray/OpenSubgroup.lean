# Every open subgroup of the idele class group contains a ray subgroup

Let `K` be a number field.  The ray subgroups `raySubgroup 𝔪`, indexed by the moduli `𝔪` of `K`,
are open subgroups of the idele class group `C_K`.  This file proves that they are cofinal among
all open subgroups: every open subgroup of `C_K` contains `raySubgroup 𝔪` for some modulus `𝔪`.
Consequently the finite quotients `C_K / raySubgroup 𝔪 ≅ Cl_𝔪` see every open subgroup, which is
what identifies the continuous finite-order characters of `C_K` with the ray class characters.

The proof works in the idele group.  An open subgroup `V` of the ideles is a neighbourhood of `1`,
so it contains all ideles `x` with `x` and `x⁻¹` in a neighbourhood `W` of `1` in the adele ring.
The finite part of `W` contains a basic congruence neighbourhood: integrality at every finite
place and a congruence `x_v ≡ 1` to some level `n v` at finitely many places `v`.  The modulus `𝔪`
with exponent `n v` at those places and every real place in its infinite part therefore has
`ideleCongruenceSubgroup 𝔪 ≤ V`, once the archimedean components are handled: an open subgroup is
closed, so `V` contains every connected set of ideles through `1`, hence all ideles concentrated at
a complex place and all positive ideles concentrated at a real place.  The finite and archimedean
components of a congruence idele are then separately in `V`.

Since the ray subgroups and the idele congruence subgroups are themselves open, a subgroup of the
idele class group or of the idele group is open exactly when it contains one of them.

## Main results

  at a complex place and every positive idele concentrated at a real place lies in the identity
  component of the idele group.

  contains every idele concentrated at a complex place and every positive idele concentrated at a
  real place.
* `TauCeti.GlobalNumberFields.exists_ideleCongruenceSubgroup_ofFiniteIdele_mem_of_mem_nhds`: every
  neighbourhood of `1` in the idele group contains the finite parts of the ideles of some idele
  congruence subgroup.
* `TauCeti.GlobalNumberFields.exists_ideleCongruenceSubgroup_le_of_isOpen`: every open subgroup
  of the idele group contains an idele congruence subgroup.
* `TauCeti.GlobalNumberFields.isOpen_iff_exists_ideleCongruenceSubgroup_le`: a subgroup of the
  idele group is open exactly when it contains an idele congruence subgroup.
* `TauCeti.GlobalNumberFields.exists_raySubgroup_le_of_isOpen`: every open subgroup of the idele
  class group contains a ray subgroup.

/-- **The finite parts of an idele congruence subgroup are small.** For every neighbourhood `N` of
`1` in the idele group there is a modulus `𝔪` such that the finite part of every idele of
`ideleCongruenceSubgroup 𝔪`, that is, the idele with the same finite components and trivial
infinite components, lies in `N`.  The infinite components need separate treatment, because the
congruence subgroup imposes no bound on them. -/
