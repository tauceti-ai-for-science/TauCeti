# Quadratic conjugation and the real places

Let `K = ℚ(√d)` be a quadratic number field, presented by `θ : 𝓞 K` with `minpoly ℤ θ = X ^ 2 - d`
and `Algebra.adjoin ℚ {θ} = ⊤`, and let `σ = quadraticConj` be its nontrivial `ℚ`-automorphism. A
ring homomorphism `K →+* ℝ` is determined by the value it gives `θ`, and that value is one of the
two real square roots of `d`; so any two real embeddings of `K` either agree or differ by `σ`.

The arithmetic consequence recorded here is a **sign** statement: if `z / σz` is totally positive
then `z` and `σz` have the same sign at each real place, and since the real embeddings are `φ` and
`φ ∘ σ`, all real embeddings of `z` share one sign. Hence `z` or `-z` is totally positive, so the
principal ideal `(z)` has a totally positive generator.

This is the archimedean input to the *narrow* ambiguous class number formula: it is what replaces
the total-complexity hypothesis of the ordinary Hilbert-90 descent
(`NumberField.exists_map_ringOfIntegersQuadraticConj_eq_self_of_sq_eq_one`), where the sign of the
norm had to be controlled instead. Layer 3 of the multiquadratic roadmap needs the narrow class
group for real quadratic fields, where the ordinary descent fails.

## Main results

* `NumberField.realRingHom_eq_or_eq_comp_quadraticConj`: two real embeddings of a quadratic field
  either agree or differ by quadratic conjugation.
* `NumberField.isTotallyPositive_or_isTotallyPositive_neg_of_isTotallyPositive_div_quadraticConj`:
  if `z / σ z` is totally positive then `z` or `-z` is totally positive.
* `NumberField.isTotallyPositive_or_isTotallyPositive_neg_of_norm_pos`: an element of positive
  norm is, up to sign, totally positive.
* `NumberField.exists_unit_isTotallyPositive_smul_of_norm_pos`: the same statement with the sign
  read as a unit of `𝓞 K` scaling the element to a totally positive one.

/-- **The real embeddings of a quadratic field differ by conjugation.** Since `ρ θ` squares to the
rational `d` for every ring homomorphism `ρ : K →+* ℝ`, two of them send `θ` to the same square root
of `d` — in which case they agree — or to opposite ones, in which case one is the other precomposed
with quadratic conjugation. -/

/-- **A quotient by its conjugate that is totally positive forces a sign.** If `z / σ z` is totally
positive, then `z` and `σ z` have the same sign at each real place; since every
real embedding is either `φ` or `φ ∘ σ` for one fixed `φ`, all real embeddings of `z` have the same
sign, so `z` or `-z` is totally positive. Over a totally complex field both alternatives hold
vacuously. -/

/-- **Positive norm forces a sign.** In a quadratic field the norm of `x` is the product of the
two values `φ x` and `φ (σ x)` that the real embeddings give `x`, so a positive norm says those
values have the same sign and hence that `x` or `-x` is totally positive. Over a totally complex
field both alternatives hold vacuously. -/

/-- **An element of positive norm has a totally positive unit multiple.** The unit-scaling form of
`isTotallyPositive_or_isTotallyPositive_neg_of_norm_pos`: since `-1` is a unit of `𝓞 K`, the two
alternatives of that sign statement are a single existential over the units. This is the shape in
which a narrow principal class is shown to be trivial. -/
