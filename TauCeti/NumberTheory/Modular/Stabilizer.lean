# Orders of the point stabilisers of the modular group

The stabiliser of a point of `ℍ` in `SL(2, ℤ)` is finite, and its order depends only on the
orbit. Off the two elliptic orbits that order is `2` — the centre `±1`, which acts trivially —
while on the orbit of `i` it is `4` and on the orbit of `ρ` it is `6`. Dividing by the centre
these are the `PSL(2, ℤ)`-orders `e_i = 2`, `e_ρ = 3` and `e_P = 1` elsewhere, the weights the
valence formula attaches to its orbits.

Mathlib classifies the stabilising matrices (`ModularGroup.stabilizer_I`,
`ModularGroup.stabilizer_ρ`, `ModularGroup.stabilizer_of_ne`), but only at a point of the closed
fundamental domain `𝒟`. Added here is the passage to an arbitrary point of `ℍ`, which
`ModularGroup.exists_smul_mem_fd` and conjugation supply, together with the resulting counts.

The three orbit-level counts are stated with their hypotheses on the class of `z` in
`MulAction.orbitRel.Quotient SL(2, ℤ) ℍ`, rather than on a fundamental-domain representative,
because that is the form the valence formula's index type consumes: its non-elliptic orbits are
literally the `q` with `q ≠ ⟦i⟧` and `q ≠ ⟦ρ⟧`.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.ModularGroup.finite_stabilizer`: every point stabiliser is finite, so the elliptic
  order is defined at every point of `ℍ`.
* `TauCeti.ModularGroup.card_stabilizer_I` and `TauCeti.ModularGroup.card_stabilizer_ρ`: the
  orders `4` and `6` at the two elliptic points themselves.
* `TauCeti.ModularGroup.card_stabilizer_of_orbit_eq_I` and
  `TauCeti.ModularGroup.card_stabilizer_of_orbit_eq_ρ`: the same orders everywhere on those two
  orbits.
* `TauCeti.ModularGroup.card_stabilizer_eq_two_of_orbit_ne_I_of_orbit_ne_ρ`: order `2` on every
  other orbit.
* `TauCeti.ModularGroup.card_stabilizer_eq_card_center_mul_card_stabilizer_psl`: for any
  `Γ ≤ SL(2, ℤ)`, the stabiliser order in `Γ` splits off the part of the centre that `Γ`
  contains, leaving the projective order in `Γ`'s image in `PSL(2, ℤ)`.
* `TauCeti.ModularGroup.card_stabilizer_eq_two_mul_card_stabilizer_psl`: the projective order is
  the matrix one halved.
* `TauCeti.ModularGroup.card_stabilizer_psl_I`, `TauCeti.ModularGroup.card_stabilizer_psl_ρ` and
  `TauCeti.ModularGroup.card_stabilizer_psl_eq_one_of_orbit_ne_I_of_orbit_ne_ρ`: the resulting
  elliptic orders `e_i = 2`, `e_ρ = 3` and `e_P = 1`.
* `TauCeti.ModularGroup.ellipticOrder`: those orders assembled into a single function `e_P` on
  the orbit space, with `TauCeti.ModularGroup.ellipticOrder_I`,
  `TauCeti.ModularGroup.ellipticOrder_ρ`, `TauCeti.ModularGroup.ellipticOrder_pos`,
  `TauCeti.ModularGroup.ellipticOrder_le_three` and
  `TauCeti.ModularGroup.cardStabilizerOnOrbit_eq_two_mul_ellipticOrder`.

/-! ### The projective orders `e_P` -/

/-- **The stabiliser order in `Γ` splits off the part of the centre that `Γ` contains.** For any
`Γ ≤ SL(2, ℤ)`, the order of the stabiliser of `z` in `Γ` is the order of `Γ ⊓ ±1` times the
order of the stabiliser in the image of `Γ` in `PSL(2, ℤ)` — the projective, elliptic order. The
factor is `2` when `-I ∈ Γ` and `1` otherwise, by
`Matrix.SpecialLinearGroup.card_center_subgroupOf_eq_two_iff`.

This is the general-level form of the halving below, and it is exactly one application of
`TauCeti.card_stabilizer_eq_card_subgroupOf_mul_card_stabilizer_map`: no quotient action of `Γ`
has to be built, because the image of `Γ` in `PSL(2, ℤ)` is a subgroup of `PSL(2, ℤ)`, which
already acts on `ℍ`. Compatibility of the two actions is definitional, since `PSL(2, R)` is
`SL(2, R) ⧸ center` and `pslMk_smul` is `rfl`. -/

/-- **The `SL(2, ℤ)`-stabiliser order is twice the `PSL(2, ℤ)` one.** The two differ exactly by
the centre `±1`, which acts trivially on `ℍ`, so every projective stabiliser is the matrix one
halved — the passage from the counts `4`, `6`, `2` to the elliptic orders `e_P`. -/

/-! ### The elliptic order of an orbit -/

/-- **The elliptic order `e_P` of an `SL(2, ℤ)`-orbit of `ℍ`**: the order of the stabiliser, in
`PSL(2, ℤ)`, of any point of the orbit. It is `2` on the orbit of `i`, `3` on the orbit of `ρ`
and `1` everywhere else, and the valence formula weights an orbit by its reciprocal `1 / e_P`.

The index type is the `SL(2, ℤ)`-orbit space, because that is the one the order divisor
`TauCeti.ModularForm.orderOfVanishingOnOrbit` is defined on, while the count is taken in
`PSL(2, ℤ)`, which is the group acting effectively. So this is not an instance of the generic
`TauCeti.cardStabilizerOnOrbit`, whose quotient and whose group are the same; the two are
related by `cardStabilizerOnOrbit_eq_two_mul_ellipticOrder`. -/
