# The quadratic defect

Let `K` be a nonarchimedean local field with ring of integers `𝒪[K]`. The quadratic defect of
`a : Kˣ` is O'Meara's fractional ideal

`𝔡(a) = ⋂_{ξ ∈ K} (a - ξ²) 𝒪[K]`,

which measures how well `a` can be approximated by squares of `K`. Its exponent is
`δ(a) = sup_{ξ ∈ K} v_K(a - ξ²) ∈ ℤ ∪ {⊤}` for the normalized valuation `v_K`.

`FractionalIdeal` is a lattice without infima of infinite families, so the defect is defined as
the greatest lower bound of the principal fractional ideals `(a - ξ²) 𝒪[K]`, and
`TauCeti.isGLB_quadraticDefect` records that property. The infimum is attained: the approximation
orders `v_K(a - ξ²)` of a nonsquare are bounded, because a sequence of better and better
approximations would have a common point in the compact closed ball of radius
`max 1 (valuation K a)`, giving a square root of `a`.
Consequently the defect of a nonsquare is the principal fractional ideal `𝓂[K] ^ δ(a)`, while the
defect of a square is `0` and its exponent is `⊤`.

The results here are the calculus of the defect used to compute Hilbert symbols over `K`: the
defect vanishes exactly on squares, it scales by `c²` when `a` is multiplied by `c²`, the defect of
an integral element is integral, and the defect of an element of odd valuation `v_K(a)` is
`a 𝒪[K]`. None of that needs a hypothesis on the residue characteristic.

The classification below additionally assumes `(2 : K) ≠ 0`. For `e = v_K(2)` and a unit `u`,
`𝔡(u)` runs through the list `0`, `4 𝒪[K] = 𝓂[K]^{2e}`, and `𝓂[K]^{2k+1}` for `0 ≤ k < e`, with
the value `0` occurring exactly when `u` is a square. If `u` is not a square, `δ(u)` is `2e` or an
odd number below `2e`. The upper bound is the sharp local square theorem, and the parity is an
approximation argument: below depth `2e` the cross term `2 ξ π^k s` is negligible, so an
approximation of even order can always be improved using that the residue field is perfect of
characteristic two. Every listed value is
attained: sharpness supplies the value `2e`, and `1 + π^(2k+1)` has defect exponent `2k+1`.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.quadraticDefect`: the quadratic defect `𝔡(a)`, a fractional ideal of `𝒪[K]`.
* `TauCeti.defectExponent`: its exponent `δ(a) : WithTop ℤ`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.isGLB_quadraticDefect`: `𝔡(a)` is the greatest lower bound of the ideals
  `(a - ξ²) 𝒪[K]`, and `TauCeti.exists_quadraticDefect_eq_spanSingleton`: it is one of them.
* `TauCeti.quadraticDefect_eq_zero_iff` and `TauCeti.defectExponent_eq_top_iff`: the defect
  detects squares.
* `TauCeti.quadraticDefect_eq_maximalIdeal_zpow`: `𝔡(a) = 𝓂[K] ^ δ(a)` for a nonsquare `a`.
* `TauCeti.quadraticDefect_mul_sq` and `TauCeti.defectExponent_mul_sq`: behaviour under
  multiplication by a square.
* `TauCeti.quadraticDefect_of_odd` and `TauCeti.defectExponent_of_odd`: the defect of
  an element of odd valuation.
* `TauCeti.defectExponent_le_two_mul_natCastValuation`: the defect exponent of a nonsquare unit
  is at most `2 v_K(2)`.
* `TauCeti.defectExponent_eq_two_mul_natCastValuation_or_odd` and
  `TauCeti.quadraticDefect_eq_maximalIdeal_zpow_or_odd`: the possible defects of a unit.
* `TauCeti.exists_unit_defectExponent_eq_two_mul_natCastValuation` and
  `TauCeti.defectExponent_one_add_pow_odd`: every entry in that list is attained, with an explicit
  representative for each odd exponent.
