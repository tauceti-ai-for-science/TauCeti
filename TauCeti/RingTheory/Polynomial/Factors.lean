# The monic irreducible factors of a polynomial over a field

For a polynomial `f` over a field `K`, `Polynomial.Factors f` is the type of its distinct monic
irreducible factors: the subtype of `K[X]` cut out by `Irreducible p ∧ p.Monic ∧ p ∣ f`. Working
with this subtype rather than with `normalizedFactors f` keeps `DecidableEq K` out of the
statements; the two are compared by Mathlib's `Polynomial.mem_normalizedFactors_iff`, whose
conjunct order the predicate above follows.

The factors are pairwise coprime, and when `f` is nonzero and squarefree their product is
associated to `f`, so the ideal `(f)` is the intersection of the ideals `(p)`. That is the input
for the Chinese Remainder decomposition of `K[X] ⧸ (f)` into the fields `K[X] ⧸ (p)`.

## Main definitions

* `Polynomial.Factors`: the distinct monic irreducible factors of `f`, as a type.
* `Polynomial.Factors.linearEquivRoots`: the linear factors correspond to the roots of `f`, with
  `linearEquivRoots_apply` and `linearEquivRoots_symm_apply` computing both directions.

## Main results

* `Polynomial.Factors.finite`: a nonzero polynomial has finitely many factors.
* `Polynomial.Factors.normalizedFactors_eq_map_univ_val`: for a nonzero squarefree polynomial,
  its normalized factors are precisely the distinct monic irreducible factors.
* `Polynomial.Factors.isCoprime`: distinct factors are coprime.
* `Polynomial.Factors.span_eq_iInf_span`: for `f` nonzero and squarefree,
  `(f) = ⨅ p, (p)`.
* `Polynomial.sum_natDegree_normalizedFactors`: the degrees of the normalized irreducible
  factors, counted with multiplicity, sum to the degree.
* `Polynomial.map_natDegree_normalizedFactors_eq_singleton_iff`: those degrees form a singleton
  exactly when the polynomial is irreducible.
* `Polynomial.count_one_map_natDegree_normalizedFactors`: a nonzero squarefree polynomial has as
  many linear normalized factors as distinct roots.
* `Polynomial.monic_squarefree_normalizedFactors_prod`: a product of distinct monic irreducible
  polynomials is monic and squarefree, and its normalized factors are those polynomials.

/-! ### Degrees of the normalized irreducible factors

`Polynomial.Factors` keeps `DecidableEq K` out of its statements by working with a subtype, at
the cost of forgetting multiplicities. The lemmas below are the counterparts for
`normalizedFactors`, which does record them.
