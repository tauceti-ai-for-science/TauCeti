# Homomorphisms topologically of finite type

Wedhorn's §6.6. A ring homomorphism `φ : A → B` is *topologically of finite type* when `B` is
presented as an `A`-algebra by an open quotient map out of the completion of a weighted restricted
power-series ring `A⟨X₁, …, Xₖ⟩_T` on finitely many variables, each weight `Tᵢ` finite. It is
*strictly* topologically of finite type when the trivial weight family `Tᵢ = {1}` suffices, so
that the presenting algebra is `TauCeti.Huber.restrictedMvPowerSeriesCompletion`, the object this
library writes `A⟨X₁, …, Xₖ⟩`.

The notion is what three results the adic-spaces roadmap needs are stated in terms of: the second
half of Proposition and Definition 6.36 (a Tate ring is strongly noetherian exactly when every
Tate ring topologically of finite type over it is noetherian), Remark 6.37(1), and Example 6.38,
which Proposition 8.30 cites by name.

## What is and is not assumed

Wedhorn states 6.28 and 6.29 for an `f`-adic `A` and a *complete* `f`-adic `B`. **Those standing
hypotheses are deliberately not imposed here**: the definitions ask only that `A` be a
nonarchimedean topological commutative ring — the least that lets `A⟨X⟩_T` be formed at all — and
that `B` be a topological commutative ring. The predicates are therefore defined on a wider class
than Wedhorn's, and agree with his on the class he considers. A consumer that needs completeness
of `B` should assume it alongside, not read it out of these definitions.

## Notation, and one thing it is easy to get backwards

`A⟨X₁, …, Xₖ⟩_T` names the **uncompleted** weighted ring `TauCeti.Huber.weightedRestrictedSubring`
of Wedhorn's Remark and Definition 5.48, as it does in the roadmap (`AdicSpaces/README.md`, §0.4).
Wedhorn's presenting algebra in 6.28/6.29 is its **completion**, which he writes `Â⟨…⟩`; at the
trivial weight family that completion is `restrictedMvPowerSeriesCompletion`, which this library
writes `A⟨X₁, …, Xₖ⟩` without a subscript. So the domain of `π` below is a completion throughout,
never the subring itself.

## The weighted algebra, and why not the Tate-only one

The presenting algebra is the **weighted** one. That is Wedhorn's own 6.29(i), and it is what the
roadmap asks for (`AdicSpaces/README.md`, §5.2): the Tate-only algebra is too narrow downstream,
since `A_inf` is Huber and not Tate. Definition 6.28, the strict variant, is the Tate-only case;
the implication between them is `IsStrictlyTopologicallyFiniteType.isTopologicallyFiniteType`, and
over a Tate ring the converse `IsTopologicallyFiniteType.isStrictlyTopologicallyFiniteType` holds
as well.

Two conditions on the weight family are in play and they are not the same. Wedhorn's standing
hypothesis on `T` — needed even to *form* `A⟨X⟩_T` — is `TauCeti.Huber.IsWeightFamily`, that
`Tᵢ^m · U` is a neighbourhood of zero for every `m` and every neighbourhood `U` of zero. The
phrasing in 6.29(i), that each `Tᵢ · A` is open, is the `U = ⊤` case, and is recovered from it by
`TauCeti.Huber.IsWeightFamily.isOpen_weightMul_top`; the converse is not available here (see that
lemma's docstring). Finiteness of each `Tᵢ` is a separate requirement of 6.29(i) — it is what makes
the notion one of *finite* type — and is carried explicitly, since `IsWeightFamily` does not imply
it.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.Huber.IsStrictlyTopologicallyFiniteType`: Wedhorn Definition 6.28.
* `TauCeti.Huber.IsTopologicallyFiniteType`: Wedhorn Proposition and Definition 6.29(i).

## Main results

* `TauCeti.Huber.isStrictlyTopologicallyFiniteType_algebraMap`: the structure map
  `A → A⟨X₁, …, Xₖ⟩` is strictly topologically of finite type — the presentation by the identity.
* `TauCeti.Huber.IsStrictlyTopologicallyFiniteType.isTopologicallyFiniteType`: strictly
  topologically of finite type implies topologically of finite type, by the trivial weight family.
* `TauCeti.Huber.IsTopologicallyFiniteType.continuous`: such a `φ` is continuous, since it factors
  through the presenting algebra's structure map.
* `TauCeti.Huber.IsTopologicallyFiniteType.isOpen_map`: out of a Huber ring, such a `φ` carries
  open ideals to ideals generating open ideals.
* `TauCeti.Huber.IsStrictlyTopologicallyFiniteType.comp_isOpenQuotientMap` and
  `TauCeti.Huber.IsTopologicallyFiniteType.comp_isOpenQuotientMap`: both notions are stable under
  composing with a further open quotient map.
* `TauCeti.Huber.IsStrictlyTopologicallyFiniteType.quotientMk` and
  `TauCeti.Huber.IsTopologicallyFiniteType.quotientMk`: in particular, stable under passing to a
  quotient by an ideal.
* `TauCeti.Huber.IsTopologicallyFiniteType.comp_ringEquiv`: topological finite type is stable
  under precomposing with an isomorphism of topological rings of the base.
* `TauCeti.Huber.isStrictlyTopologicallyFiniteType_quotientMk_algebraMap`: every quotient of
  `A⟨X₁, …, Xₖ⟩` is strictly topologically of finite type over `A` — the shape of every Laurent
  and rational presentation.
* `TauCeti.Huber.isStrictlyTopologicallyFiniteType_id`: the identity of a complete Hausdorff
  nonarchimedean ring is strictly topologically of finite type, presented with no variables.
* `TauCeti.Huber.IsStrictlyTopologicallyFiniteType.isStronglyNoetherian`: over a strongly
  noetherian Huber ring, an algebra strictly topologically of finite type is again strongly
  noetherian.
* `TauCeti.Huber.isStrictlyTopologicallyFiniteType_of_surjective`: **over a Tate ring, a
  surjection out of `A⟨X₁, …, Xₖ⟩` that is continuous at zero is already a strict
  presentation** — openness is supplied by the open mapping theorem rather than assumed.
* `TauCeti.Huber.isStrictlyTopologicallyFiniteType_algebraMap_completion_weightedRestrictedSubring`:
  over a Tate ring the completion of `A⟨X₁, …, Xₖ⟩_T` is strictly topologically of finite type,
  presented by one variable for each element of each `Tᵢ`.
* `TauCeti.Huber.IsTopologicallyFiniteType.isStrictlyTopologicallyFiniteType` and
  `TauCeti.Huber.isStrictlyTopologicallyFiniteType_iff_isTopologicallyFiniteType`: over a Tate
  ring the two notions agree, Wedhorn Proposition 6.34.
* `TauCeti.Huber.IsTopologicallyFiniteType.isStronglyNoetherian`: over a strongly noetherian Tate
  ring, an algebra topologically of finite type is strongly noetherian.

Wedhorn presents an algebra topologically of finite type as an open quotient of a restricted

presentation of the same shape. This is what lets a *quotient* of `A⟨X₁, …, Xₖ⟩` — the form every
rational localisation and Laurent presentation takes — inherit finite type without exhibiting a
fresh presentation by hand.

known to be strictly topologically of finite type.

`TauCeti.Huber.PairOfDefinition.flat_restrictionRingHomOfSubset_of_forall_isStronglyNoetherian`
asks that every rational localisation in a cover be strongly noetherian. Combined with a strict
finite type presentation of such a localisation over its base — the shape
`TauCeti.Huber.isStrictlyTopologicallyFiniteType_quotientMk_algebraMap` produces, and the one

Over a Tate ring a strict presentation need not be exhibited as an *open* map: **openness is
automatic**. A surjection out of `A⟨X₁, …, Xₖ⟩` onto a complete Hausdorff first countable algebra
that is continuous at zero is open, so continuity and surjectivity together already make it a
strict presentation.

The hypotheses on the target are the standing hypotheses of Wedhorn's §8.2: complete, Hausdorff,
and first countable in the form of a countably generated uniformity. The source needs nothing
beyond what `A⟨X₁, …, Xₖ⟩` already carries.

The target is an arbitrary ring receiving a surjection, not the literal quotient type

/-! ### Weighted presentations over a Tate ring

Over a Tate ring the weights can be removed: the completed weighted algebra `A⟨X₁, …, Xₖ⟩_T` is an
open quotient of an unweighted `A⟨Yⱼ⟩`, with one variable `Y_{(i, t)}` for each `t ∈ Tᵢ`, sent to
`t Xᵢ`. Consequently the two finite-type notions of Wedhorn's §6.6 coincide over a Tate ring
(Wedhorn Proposition 6.34), and strong noetherianness passes to every algebra topologically of
finite type over a strongly noetherian Tate ring, which is the input to Corollary 8.35.
