# The localisation topology: the universal property

A ring homomorphism out of `Aₛ` is continuous as soon as its restriction along `algebraMap` is and
the fractions `t/s` go to power-bounded elements; and `Aₛ` is the universal such target. This is
the second half of Wedhorn's Proposition and Definition 5.51.

The construction of the topology is in `LocalizationTopology.Basic`, and the completion `A⟨T/s⟩`
in `LocalizationTopology.Completion`.

The power-boundedness prerequisites this needs — `isPowerBounded_of_mem_locSubring` and
`isPowerBounded_divBy`, which say every element of `D`, in particular each fraction `t/s`, is
power-bounded — are in `LocalizationTopology.Basic` and imported from there.

## Main results

* `continuous_of_continuous_algebraMap_of_isPowerBounded`: a sufficient criterion for a ring
  homomorphism out of `Aₛ` to be continuous. The converse is not proved here.
* `locTopology_congr_pairOfDefinition`: the topology on `Aₛ` does not depend on the pair of
  definition.
* `existsUnique_continuous_ringHom_locTopology`: the universal property — a continuous
  `φ : A →+* B` inverting `s` and sending each `t/s` to a power-bounded element extends to `Aₛ` in
  exactly one continuous way.

## Provenance

The declarations here other than `locTopology_congr_pairOfDefinition` are relocated from the
AINTLIB port recorded in `LocalizationTopology.Basic`; see that module's Provenance section for
the source file and commit.

power-boundedness of the fractions enters: the induction adjoins one `t/s` at a time and writes an

/-- A ring homomorphism out of `Aₛ` is continuous for the localisation topology as soon as its
restriction along `algebraMap` is continuous and the fractions `t/s` are sent to power-bounded
elements. This is a sufficient criterion only; no converse is proved here.

The second hypothesis does real work rather than following from the first: `D` is generated over
`A₀` by exactly those fractions, so continuity of `f ∘ algebraMap` alone says nothing about the
image of `D`. -/

/-- **The localisation topology does not depend on the pair of definition.** Two pairs of
definition for which `(T, s)` satisfies the standing hypothesis `HasDenominatorPower` give `Aₛ`
the same topology. Wedhorn's Proposition and Definition 5.51 characterises `A(T/s)` by a universal
property that names no pair of definition; this is the corresponding fact for `locTopology`, which
is built from one.

Compare `locTopology_congr`, which instead fixes the pair of definition and changes the presentation
`(T, s)` to one with the same ring of definition. When `T` spans an open ideal,
`hasDenominatorPower_of_isOpen_span` supplies both standing hypotheses. -/

/-! ### The universal property -/

/-- **Wedhorn 5.51, the universal property of `Aₛ` under `locTopology`.** A ring homomorphism
`φ : A →+* B` into a nonarchimedean ring extends to `Aₛ` in exactly one continuous way, provided
`φ` is continuous, `φ s` is a unit, and each fraction `φ t / φ s` is power-bounded.

The condition on the fractions is stated as sufficient, and only that. It is *not* forced by
continuity: a continuous ring homomorphism need not carry power-bounded elements to power-bounded
elements — `IsBounded.image` in `Huber/Bounded.lean` is stated for the image under a map, and
`IsBounded.image_of_isOpenMap` needs openness on top, precisely because continuity alone does not
suffice. Whether some weaker condition is also necessary is not addressed here.

The map itself is Mathlib's `IsLocalization.Away.lift`, which is purely algebraic and needs no
topology; the topology's contribution is that this lift is *continuous*, supplied by
`continuous_of_continuous_algebraMap_of_isPowerBounded`. Uniqueness is
`IsLocalization.ringHom_ext` and is algebraic too: a homomorphism out of a localisation is already
determined by its restriction along `algebraMap`, so nothing topological enters there. -/
