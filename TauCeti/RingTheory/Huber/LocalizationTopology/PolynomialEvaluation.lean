# Evaluating polynomials at the fractions of a rational subset

For numerators `t₁, …, tₖ` drawn from `T`, the evaluation `Xᵢ ↦ tᵢ/s` of *polynomials* lands in
the localisation `Aₛ = A⟨T/s⟩` itself, not in its completion: a polynomial in the fractions is a
finite sum, so no convergence is involved. That is what makes this map one the completion functor
can be applied to, and it is why this material sits below
`TauCeti.RingTheory.Huber.LocalizationTopology.Evaluation` rather than beside the completed
evaluation defined there — nothing here needs completion theory.

The three properties together present `Aₛ` as an open quotient of a polynomial ring. They need
different hypotheses, and the distinction matters:

* surjectivity asks the numerators *together with `s`* to generate the unit ideal, which is what
  makes the fractions generate `Aₛ` over `A`;
* openness asks that every fraction `t/s` with `t ∈ T` — and these are what the neighbourhoods
  of `Aₛ` are built from — already occurs among the `tᵢ/s`. It is the *fractions* that must be
  matched, not the numerators: distinct `t` may have the same image in `Aₛ`;
* continuity asks that each fraction `tᵢ/s` lie in the ring of definition `D` of `Aₛ`. That is
  weaker than either of the others and is implied by `tᵢ ∈ T`, via
  `TauCeti.Huber.PairOfDefinition.divBy_mem_locSubring`; it is stated in this form so that a
  caller whose fractions lie in `D` for another reason need not exhibit them as elements of `T`.

None of the three implies another, so the bundled result carries all three hypotheses.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.Huber.polyEvalHom`, with
  `TauCeti.Huber.polyEvalHom_weightedPolynomialsEquiv_apply` as its characteristic
  equation, and `TauCeti.Huber.PairOfDefinition.isOpenQuotientMap_polyEvalHom` bundling the three
  properties above.
* `TauCeti.Huber.PairOfDefinition.exists_aeval_eq_of_mem_locIdealImage`: every element of the
  `n`-th neighbourhood of `Aₛ` is the value of a polynomial whose coefficients lie in `Iⁿ`. This
  direction is what makes the evaluation open; it is an existence statement, not a
  characterisation.
* the two directions of that characterisation in the `Fin k` indexing the evaluation uses,
  `TauCeti.Huber.PairOfDefinition.exists_polynomial_coeff_mem_idealImage` and
  `TauCeti.Huber.PairOfDefinition.aeval_mem_locIdealImage_of_coeff_mem`. Openness is proved from
  the first and continuity from the second, and a consumer wanting either half of the
  correspondence between neighbourhoods and coefficient conditions should use these.

## References

* [T. Wedhorn, *Adic Spaces*][wedhorn_adic] (arXiv:1910.05934v1), Definition 6.28 and
  Example 6.38, for which this is the downstairs half. Example 6.38 is what Proposition 8.30
  cites by name; the proposition's own conclusion is flatness of restriction maps, so this file
  is upstream of it and is not part of its statement.

/-- **The polynomial evaluation `Xᵢ ↦ tᵢ/s` is an open map**, when the fractions of `T` all
occur among the `tᵢ/s`.

This asserts openness only. Surjectivity is a separate statement with a separate hypothesis —
`TauCeti.Huber.polyEvalHom_surjective`, which asks the numerators together with `s`
to generate the unit ideal.

Together with `TauCeti.Huber.polyEvalHom_surjective` and
`TauCeti.Huber.PairOfDefinition.continuous_polyEvalHom` — the three bundled as
`TauCeti.Huber.PairOfDefinition.isOpenQuotientMap_polyEvalHom` — this presents `Aₛ` as an
open quotient of a polynomial ring. That is exactly the input `AddMonoidHom.surjective_completion`
and `AddMonoidHom.isOpenMap_completion` take, so it is what carries the presentation to the
completions `A⟨X₁, …, Xₖ⟩ → A⟨T/s⟩`, exhibiting `A⟨T/s⟩` as strictly topologically of finite
type over `A` — Wedhorn's Definition 6.28 at Example 6.38 — and through it the strong
noetherianity of a rational localisation. That strong noetherianity is what Proposition 8.30
consumes; the proposition itself concludes flatness of restriction maps and is not proved here.

Openness is the half of the presentation that does not come for free. Surjectivity is a
statement about generation, whereas openness compares two topologies that were defined
independently: `Aₛ` carries the localisation topology, not a quotient topology transported
from the polynomials.

`hTt` asks that every fraction generating a neighbourhood of `Aₛ` already occurs among the
`tᵢ/s`. It is stated on fractions rather than on numerators — `↑T ⊆ Set.range t` would do, and
is what a caller usually has, but the argument only ever compares images in `Aₛ`. It neither
implies nor is implied by the unit-ideal condition surjectivity needs. -/
