# Nakayama for a matrix with topologically nilpotent entries

Over a complete nonarchimedean ring, `1 - B` is invertible as soon as every entry of `B` is
topologically nilpotent, and consequently a family satisfying `yᵢ = ∑ⱼ Bᵢⱼ • yⱼ` vanishes.

The vanishing argument is split from its topological input. Once `1 - B` is a unit the conclusion
is pure algebra, and `TauCeti.eq_zero_of_isUnit_one_sub_of_forall_eq_sum_smul` states it that way
in `TauCeti.LinearAlgebra.Matrix.Module`, where it needs no ring theory at all: the module `P`
carries **no topology**, and `A` need not be commutative, which is what lets it be applied where
`P` is an abstract subquotient. This file supplies only the topological input.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.Huber.isTopologicallyNilpotent_one_sub_det_one_sub`: `1 - det (1 - B)` is topologically
  nilpotent.
* `TauCeti.Huber.isUnit_one_sub_of_isTopologicallyNilpotent_entries`: hence `1 - B` is a unit.
* `TauCeti.Huber.eq_zero_of_isTopologicallyNilpotent_entries_of_forall_eq_sum_smul`: the
  topological criterion combined with the algebraic core, which is imported from
  `TauCeti.LinearAlgebra.Matrix.Module`.

## References

* [S. Bosch, U. Güntzer and R. Remmert, *Non-Archimedean Analysis*][bosch-guntzer-remmert],
  §3.7.2/1, where this is the algebraic engine behind closedness of finitely generated submodules.

## Provenance

AINTLIB (`github.com/CBirkbeck/AINTLIB` @ `37bbdaeb9`, Apache-2.0) has all three of the
topological statements in `projects/AdicSpaces/Adic spaces/Bounded.lean` —
`IsTopologicallyNilpotent.one_sub_det_one_sub_matrix` (:666),
`IsTopologicallyNilpotent.isUnit_one_sub_matrix` (:704) and
`eq_zero_of_forall_eq_sum_topNilp_smul` (:740) — and takes **the same route**: lift to the
power-bounded subring, reduce modulo the topologically nilpotent ideal, apply `RingHom.map_det`,
then `Matrix.isUnit_iff_isUnit_det`. This module was written against this repository's own API and
compared afterwards; since the routes coincide it should be read as a re-derivation of that
argument rather than an independent one. Nothing was copied: the names differ throughout, the
hypotheses here are the plain nonarchimedean bundle rather than AINTLIB's section variables, the
vanishing step goes through Mathlib's `Matrix.Module` action, and the algebraic core is split out,
which AINTLIB does not do.
