# Evaluating a substitution over coefficients that need not be discrete

Mathlib evaluates a substitution only over discrete coefficients: `MvPowerSeries.eval₂_subst` and
`MvPowerSeries.comp_subst_apply` both carry `[DiscreteUniformity R] [DiscreteUniformity S]` on the
two coefficient rings. That is unsatisfiable exactly where the statement is wanted. Substituting a
parameter into a formal expansion over an adic ring and evaluating back into that same ring needs
the coefficients and the evaluation target to be the *same* type, and one type cannot carry both
the adic and the discrete uniformity as instances.

`MvPowerSeries.aeval_subst` is that conclusion with an arbitrary uniform structure on the
coefficients. Nothing topological beyond a uniformity is asked of the ring the substituted family
lives over, and the evaluation target carries exactly the hypotheses of `MvPowerSeries.comp_aeval`.
That generality is available because Mathlib's evaluation API asks for no discreteness anywhere:
discreteness enters its substitution API only through `MvPowerSeries.substAlgHom_eq_aeval`, from
how `subst` is tied to `aeval`, and not from the composition fact itself. So all three rings may
be instantiated at one adic ring with no `letI` at the use site.

Discreteness is recovered inside the proof, where it belongs. `MvPowerSeries.subst` is by
definition an evaluation for the discrete uniformities; the pi topology those induce is finer than
the ambient one (`MvPowerSeries.WithPiTopology.instTopologicalSpace_mono`); and a map continuous
for the ambient source topology is continuous for a finer one (`continuous_le_dom`). In the
discrete world both sides are therefore continuous algebra homomorphisms out of
`MvPowerSeries σ R`; `MvPowerSeries.aeval_unique` identifies each with an evaluation; and the two
evaluations agree because both send `X s` to `ε (a s)`. Every ambient fact is taken before the
uniformities are shadowed, so the evaluation the statement is about is never re-elaborated.

## Main results

* `MvPowerSeries.aeval_subst` : a continuous algebra homomorphism applied to a substitution is the
  evaluation at the substituted family.
* `PowerSeries.aeval_subst` : the same for a substitution into a univariate series.
* `PowerSeries.eval₂_toMvPowerSeries` and `PowerSeries.eval₂_id_toMvPowerSeries` : evaluating a
  univariate series viewed in several variables is evaluating it at the matching entry of the
  family — the case of `aeval_subst` at a single variable, which is how a one-variable series
  meets a two-variable evaluation.
* `MvPowerSeries.hasSubst_pair` : a pair of series with vanishing constant coefficient is a
  legitimate substitution family for the two variables indexed by `Unit ⊕ Unit`.
* `MvPowerSeries.coordSpecialize`, `MvPowerSeries.hasSubst_coordSpecialize` and the two
  `subst_coordSpecialize_X_*` lemmas : the substitution sending one coordinate variable to `X` and
  every other to `0`, for an index type of any size.
* `MvPowerSeries.ne_of_subst_eq_X_of_subst_eq_zero` : a substitution sending one series to `X` and
  another to `0` separates them.
* `MvPowerSeries.subst_powerSeriesSubst` : substituting into the composite of a one-variable
  series with a multivariate one is substituting into the inner series.
* `MvPowerSeries.constantCoeff_subst_of_constantCoeff_zero` : substituting a family of series
  without constant term preserves the constant coefficient.

## Separating multivariable parameters

The second group of results above is about *distinguishing* series rather than evaluating them.
Two series of `MvPowerSeries σ' O` can be told apart by exhibiting a substitution that sends one
to `X` and the other to `0`, since `X ≠ 0` in a nontrivial coefficient ring; `coordSpecialize i`
is the substitution that does this for the coordinate variables, specializing `X i` to `X` and
every other coordinate to `0`. Together they turn a distinctness obligation into a computation
with `subst`, which is how a multivariable identity proved by comparing parametrized points gets
its "the parameters are pairwise distinct" hypotheses. `hasSubst_pair` is the companion for the
two-variable case, packaging the substitutability side condition that every substitution into a
two-variable series has to discharge.

The two `aeval_subst` results are wanted for the formal group of an elliptic curve over a complete
local ring, where the group law is a power series over the very ring it is evaluated in: the
involution relating the `w`-expansion to the formal inverse is an identity between two such
evaluated substitutions. The two `toMvPowerSeries` results serve the same development from the
other side: the chord construction is a two-variable series, and its identities are proved by
evaluating one-variable series — `w`, the slope, the formal inverse — at entries of the pair.

## Provenance

Adapted from Michael Stoll's `EllipticCurves` (`github.com/MichaelStollBayreuth/EllipticCurves`,
Apache-2.0) at commit `66889eada51a74c2f5dfb7fb5909b0b5a0a2d96e`, file
`EllipticCurves/Mathlib/Chabauty/MvPSeries.lean`, where this is
`ChabautyColeman.MvPSeries.eval_subst`, stated for a single ring and for that development's own
`eval`. Here the three rings are independent and the statement is about Mathlib's
`MvPowerSeries.aeval`; it equally generalises Mathlib's `MvPowerSeries.eval₂_subst`, whose
`DiscreteUniformity` hypotheses it removes.

`PowerSeries.eval₂_toMvPowerSeries` and `PowerSeries.eval₂_id_toMvPowerSeries` are the same
source file's `eval_pair_rename` and `eval_pair_subst_single`, respelled: the source moves a
one-variable series into two variables along `MvPowerSeries.rename (fun _ ↦ i)`, whereas these
transport along `PowerSeries.toMvPowerSeries i`.

The proof is not the source's. That one establishes continuity of `subst` for the ambient product
topologies (its own `MvPowerSeries.continuous_subst'`) and applies uniqueness there; refining the
source topology to the discrete one instead lets Mathlib's own `MvPowerSeries.continuous_subst` do
the work, so no new continuity lemma is needed.
