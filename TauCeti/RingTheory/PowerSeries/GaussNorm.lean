# The Gauss norm of restricted power series

A restricted power series has finite Gauss norm. At a positive radius, a nonzero restricted
series has a last coefficient attaining that norm; the degree of that coefficient is the
*distinguished degree* of the series, and `IsDistinguished` names the property. Over a
nonarchimedean normed ring with multiplicative norm, a pair of distinguished degrees produces a
dominant coefficient in a product, and the Gauss norm is therefore multiplicative on restricted
series.

The distinguished degree is the datum Weierstrass division and preparation for Tate algebras are
organised around. Distinguishedness and its product law need only a seminormed coefficient ring;
nonzero restricted series attain a distinguished degree over a normed ring. No completeness
hypothesis is needed for these norm identities. The radius is any positive real number, including
the unit radius of the usual Tate algebra.

Completeness enters only in the summation section, where a family of restricted series with
summable Gauss norms is summed coefficientwise. This is the convergence statement that
successive-approximation arguments over a complete nonarchimedean ring run on, and it takes the
place of completeness of the Tate algebra for the Gauss norm.

Multiplicativity and the ultrametric inequality together make the Gauss norm a valuation with
values in `ℝ≥0` on the ring of restricted series, `gaussValuation`, whose support is trivial.
Pulled back to the Tate algebra at radii at most one, these valuations give the Gauss points of the
closed unit disc.

At a positive radius, the Gauss norm of a nonzero restricted series is attained in a finite nonempty
set of degrees. Its largest element is the distinguished degree, and its smallest is the *lowest
dominant degree* (`IsLowestDominant`); both are additive on products. Recording one of them next to
the Gauss norm refines `gaussValuation` to a valuation with values in the lexicographically ordered
group `ℝ≥0ˣ ×ₗ ℤ`: `gaussValuationAbove` records the distinguished degree and `gaussValuationBelow`
the negated lowest dominant degree. They are the Gauss norms at a radius infinitesimally above and
infinitesimally below `c`, and pulled back to the Tate algebra they give refined points of the
closed unit disc next to its Gauss points.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.PowerSeries.gaussValuation`: at a positive radius, the Gauss norm as a valuation with
  values in `ℝ≥0` on the ring of restricted series.
* `TauCeti.PowerSeries.IsDistinguished`: the Gauss norm is attained in degree `s` and every later
  coefficient is strictly smaller.
* `TauCeti.PowerSeries.IsLowestDominant`: the Gauss norm is positive and attained in degree `s`,
  and every earlier coefficient is strictly smaller.
* `TauCeti.PowerSeries.gaussValuationAbove` and `TauCeti.PowerSeries.gaussValuationBelow`: the
  Gauss valuations just above and just below a positive radius, with values in `ℝ≥0ˣ ×ₗ ℤ`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.PowerSeries.hasGaussNorm_add` and `TauCeti.PowerSeries.hasGaussNorm_mul`: bounded
  weighted coefficient norms are preserved by addition and multiplication over an ultrametric
  seminormed ring, at any nonnegative radius.
* `TauCeti.PowerSeries.gaussNorm_eq_of_forall_le`: the Gauss norm is attained at a degree whose
  weighted coefficient dominates.
* `TauCeti.PowerSeries.exists_isDistinguished`: at a positive radius, every nonzero restricted
  series is distinguished of some degree.
* `TauCeti.PowerSeries.IsDistinguished.unique`: of no more than one degree.
* `TauCeti.PowerSeries.isDistinguished_of_norm_coeff_sub_lt`: over an ultrametric ring, a series
  is distinguished once its coefficient in degree `s` is close to an element of maximal norm.
* `TauCeti.PowerSeries.IsDistinguished.trunc`,
  `TauCeti.PowerSeries.IsDistinguished.gaussNorm_trunc` and
  `TauCeti.PowerSeries.IsDistinguished.gaussNorm_sub_trunc_lt`: the polynomial part of a
  distinguished series is distinguished of the same degree and the same Gauss norm, and the
  tail it leaves is strictly smaller.
* `TauCeti.PowerSeries.IsDistinguished.norm_coeff_mul_mul_pow_eq_gaussNorm_mul`: the dominant
  coefficient of a product of distinguished series.
* `TauCeti.PowerSeries.exists_isLowestDominant`, `TauCeti.PowerSeries.IsLowestDominant.unique`
  and `TauCeti.PowerSeries.IsLowestDominant.mul`: a nonzero restricted series has exactly one
  lowest dominant degree, and lowest dominant degrees add under multiplication.
* `TauCeti.PowerSeries.gaussNorm_mul_of_isRestricted`: multiplicativity of the Gauss norm.
* `TauCeti.PowerSeries.gaussValuationAbove_le_iff` and
  `TauCeti.PowerSeries.gaussValuationBelow_le_iff`: the two refined Gauss valuations compare
  Gauss norms first, and then distinguished degrees, respectively lowest dominant degrees in the
  reverse order.
* `TauCeti.PowerSeries.gaussValuation_eq_zero_iff`: the Gauss valuation vanishes only at zero.
* `TauCeti.PowerSeries.summable_coeff_of_summable_gaussNorm` and
  `TauCeti.PowerSeries.isRestricted_mk_tsum_coeff`: over a complete ring, a family of restricted
  series with summable Gauss norms has summable coefficients, and its coefficientwise sum is
  again restricted.

The dominant-coefficient argument follows Mathlib's proof of `Polynomial.gaussNorm_mul`;
restrictedness replaces the finite-support argument for attaining the maximum. We use Mathlib's
`PowerSeries.IsRestricted` and `PowerSeries.gaussNorm` throughout.

/-- `f` is **distinguished of degree `s`** at the radius `c` when its Gauss norm at `c` is attained
in degree `s` and every later coefficient is strictly smaller.

At the unit radius this is a norm-theoretic analogue of the classical condition that the leading
coefficient of `f` dominates, in the sense of Bosch–Güntzer–Remmert §5.2. At a positive radius, a
nonzero restricted series is distinguished of exactly one degree
(`TauCeti.PowerSeries.exists_isDistinguished` and
`TauCeti.PowerSeries.IsDistinguished.unique`), so this is a genuine invariant of `f` and `c` rather
than extra data.

The first field is the univariate reading of Mathlib's `MvPowerSeries.AchievesGaussNorm`; the
second is what makes the degree unique and pins down the dominant coefficient of a product.

This is unrelated to `Polynomial.IsDistinguishedAt`, which asks a polynomial to be monic with its
remaining coefficients in an ideal. -/
