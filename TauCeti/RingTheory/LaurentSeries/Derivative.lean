# Differentiation of Laurent series

This file bundles the coefficientwise formal derivative of Laurent series as a derivation over
any commutative ring, using the Leibniz rule from `LaurentSeries.Basic`. The bundle allows the
universal property of Kähler differentials to compare it with differentiation of algebraic
functions in a local parameter.

The underlying linear map is Mathlib's `LaurentSeries.derivative`; no new differentiation
operation is introduced.
