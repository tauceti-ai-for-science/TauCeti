# Valuations of roots of monic polynomials

Elementary estimates for a valuation `ν` on a ring: a product of two `ν`-integral
elements that is a `ν`-unit has `ν`-unit factors, and for a monic polynomial `p` with
`ν`-integral coefficients the leading term dominates at any `t` with `1 < ν t`, so that
`ν (p.eval t) = ν t ^ p.natDegree`. Consequently, a root of such a polynomial has value at
most one. These estimates do not require the ring to be commutative or the value monoid to
have inverses.

## Main results

* `Valuation.eq_one_of_mul_eq_one`: if `ν a ≤ 1`, `ν b ≤ 1` and `ν (a * b) = 1`, then `ν a = 1`.
* `Valuation.map_eval_eq_of_one_lt`: `ν (p.eval t) = ν t ^ p.natDegree` for monic `p` with
  `ν`-integral coefficients and `1 < ν t`.
* `Valuation.le_one_of_root_monic`: a root of a monic polynomial with `ν`-integral coefficients
  has value at most one.
* `Valuation.map_quadratic_eq_of_one_lt` and `Valuation.one_lt_map_sq_add_mul_sub_iff`:
  `map_eval_eq_of_one_lt` for the monic quadratic `t² + at + c`, and its consequence that
  `t² + at - c` has a pole exactly where `t` does — the `x`-coordinate `λ² + a₁λ - a₂ - x₁ - x₂`
  of a chord sum, read in its slope `λ`.
* `Valuation.map_cubic_eq_of_one_lt` and `Valuation.le_one_of_root_cubic`: the two statements above
  for the monic cubic `t³ + at² + bt + c`, which is the shape a Weierstrass equation takes.

The cubic bounds apply to the Weierstrass equation: a root of the cubic is integral at every
prime where its coefficients are integral. The companion estimate, for a polynomial expression
in an element that is already integral, is `TauCeti.RingTheory.Valuation.Polynomial`.
