# Azumaya's exchange lemma

This file proves the step that drives the uniqueness half of the Krull-Schmidt theorem. Suppose a
module `M` is the internal direct sum of a finite family `Q` of indecomposable submodules, and
suppose `N` is a direct summand of `M` whose endomorphism ring is local. Then `N` is isomorphic
to one of the summands `Q i₀`, and it may be *exchanged* for it: `M` is also the direct sum of `N`
and the remaining summands `⨆ j ≠ i₀, Q j`.

The argument is the classical one. The endomorphisms of `N` obtained by projecting `N` into `Q i`
and back sum to the identity, because the
projections `TauCeti.internalProjection` onto the summands do
(`TauCeti.sum_coe_internalProjection`). The hypothesis is that `Module.End A N` is local, and in a
local ring a finite sum can only be a unit if one of its terms is
(`IsLocalRing.exists_of_isUnit_sum`); so one of those endomorphisms is an isomorphism. It factors
through `Q i₀`, and a split injection into an *indecomposable* module is already an isomorphism
(`TauCeti.IsIndecomposableModule.bijective_of_bijective_comp`), so `N ≃ₗ Q i₀`. The exchange is then
read off from the injectivity and surjectivity of that isomorphism. Locality of `Module.End A N` is
what Fitting's lemma `TauCeti.isLocalRing_end_of_isIndecomposable` supplies when `M` has finite
length.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.exists_linearEquiv_and_isCompl_biSup_ne`: **the exchange lemma**.

## Implementation notes

The exchange lemma states the decomposition of `M` as `iSupIndep` together with `⨆ i, Q i = ⊤`
rather than as `DirectSum.IsInternal`, which carries a `DecidableEq` hypothesis on the index type
that the statement does not otherwise need; that is also the form the projections of
`TauCeti/LinearAlgebra/Projection.lean` are built from. The lemma asks for `N` to come with an
explicit complement `S`, rather than deducing one, because that is how it is used: `N` is one
summand of a second decomposition of `M`, whose other summands supply `S`.

Of `N` the proof needs only that `Module.End A N` is local, so that is the hypothesis; it already
makes `N` nonzero (`TauCeti.nontrivial_of_isLocalRing_end`) and indecomposable
(`TauCeti.isIndecomposableModule_of_isLocalRing_end`), and indecomposability is never used.

/-- **Azumaya's exchange lemma.** Let `M` be the internal direct sum of a finite family `Q` of
indecomposable submodules, and let `N` be a direct summand of `M` whose endomorphism ring is local
(so in particular `N` is nonzero). Then `N` is isomorphic to one of the `Q i₀`, and can be exchanged
for it: `N` and the remaining summands `⨆ j ≠ i₀, Q j` are complementary in `M`.

The locality of `Module.End A N` is what Fitting's lemma
`TauCeti.isLocalRing_end_of_isIndecomposable` supplies when `M` has finite length. -/
