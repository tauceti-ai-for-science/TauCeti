# Finite-dimensionality of a fraction field over an intermediate field

Let `S` be finite as a module over `R`, and let `L` be a fraction field of `S`. Then `L` is
finite-dimensional over *any* intermediate field `K`, that is, any field sitting in a tower
`R → K → L`. Mathlib proves this only for the concrete `FractionRing R` and `FractionRing S`;
the statement here is about abstract fraction fields and an arbitrary intermediate field.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.IsFractionRing.finiteDimensional_of_finite`: `L` is finite-dimensional over `K`.

## Provenance

Roadmap: EllipticCurves, the Layers 0-1 target *Function-field foundations and isogenies*
(`TauCetiRoadmap/EllipticCurves/README.md:1096`). This is the fraction-field sentence of Stacks,
Lemma 10.161.5 (tag 032I).

## Implementation notes

The proof is elementary and does not use integral-closure *theory*, only the integrality of a
finite module element: `V` is the `K`-span of the image of a finite `R`-generating set of `S`, it
absorbs multiplication by the image of `S`, and it contains the inverse of every nonzero element
of that image because such an element is integral over `K` and the inverse of a nonzero integral
element lies in the algebra it generates. `L` is then `V` because every element of `L` is a
quotient of elements of the image of `S`.

/-- A fraction field `L` of a ring `S` that is finite as an `R`-module is finite-dimensional
over any intermediate field `K`, that is, any field with `R → K → L`.

This is the content of Stacks, Lemma 10.161.5 (tag 032I) — "Let `M` be a finite field extension
of the fraction field of `S`. Then `M` is also a finite field extension of `K`" — but the
hypotheses here are weaker than that sentence suggests, and deliberately so: `K` need not be a
fraction field of `R`, and no assumption on `R` beyond `Module.Finite R S` is used. No *explicit*
`IsDomain S` hypothesis is needed either, but that is not extra generality: `IsFractionRing S L`
with `L` a field already forces `algebraMap S L` to be injective, and hence `S` to be a domain.
Mathlib covers only the concrete `FractionRing R` / `FractionRing S` case. -/
