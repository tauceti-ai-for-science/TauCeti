# The monomial and Schur bases of the symmetric homogeneous polynomials

Let `σ` be a finite alphabet and `R` a commutative ring.  This file proves that the Schur
polynomials `s_μ` of `TauCeti/RingTheory/MvPolynomial/Symmetric/Schur/Basic.lean` form an
`R`-basis of the symmetric polynomials in `σ` that are homogeneous of degree `n`, indexed by the
partitions of `n` with at most `Fintype.card σ` parts.  Taken over `ℤ`, this is the
finite-alphabet, fixed-degree form of "the Schur functions are a `ℤ`-basis of the symmetric
functions"; the stable symmetric-function ring, in which the unqualified statement lives, is not
built here.

## The index set

Both `TauCeti.msymm_eq_zero_of_card_lt` and `TauCeti.schurPoly_eq_zero_iff` say that a partition
with more parts than the alphabet has letters contributes nothing, so neither family is linearly
independent when indexed by *all* partitions of `n`.  The bases below are therefore indexed by the
subtype `{ν : n.Partition // ν.parts.card ≤ Fintype.card σ}`, which is exactly the range in which
`TauCeti.partWeight` records a partition faithfully.

## The route

Everything runs through a single linear map, `TauCeti.partWeightCoeff`, reading a symmetric
homogeneous polynomial at the *sorted* monomials `TauCeti.partWeight σ ν`.  It is bijective: a
symmetric polynomial has the same coefficient at a monomial and at its sorted rearrangement
(`TauCeti.coeff_eq_coeff_partWeight`), so a symmetric homogeneous polynomial is determined by those
coefficients; and the monomial symmetric polynomials, whose coefficients at sorted monomials are
the Kronecker delta (`TauCeti.coeff_msymm_partWeight`), realize every prescription.  Reading that
bijection as a coordinate system is the monomial basis `TauCeti.msymmBasis`.

The Schur basis is the monomial basis transported along the Kostka matrix.  In the monomial basis
the coordinates of `s_μ` are the Kostka numbers `K_{μν}`
(`TauCeti.msymmBasis_repr_schurPoly`), which vanish unless `μ` dominates `ν`
(`TauCeti.kostkaNumber_eq_zero_of_not_dominates`) and equal `1` on the diagonal
(`TauCeti.kostkaNumber_self`).  Since dominance refines the lexicographic linear order on
partitions (`TauCeti.lex_le_of_dominates`), the Kostka matrix is triangular with `1`s on the
diagonal for that linear order, so its determinant is `1` and it is a change of basis.  This is
where the ring hypothesis enters: over `ℕ` the transition matrix is not invertible.

## Main definitions

The module being based, `TauCeti.symmetricHomogeneousSubmodule σ R n`, carries no Schur content and
is defined in `TauCeti/RingTheory/MvPolynomial/Symmetric/Homogeneous.lean`.

* `TauCeti.partWeightCoeff`: the coordinates of a symmetric homogeneous polynomial at the sorted
  monomials.
* `TauCeti.msymmBasis`: **the monomial basis**.
* `TauCeti.schurPolyBasis`: **the Schur basis**.
* `TauCeti.partitionEquivSchurIndex`: identifies partitions of `n` with the Schur basis index
  when the alphabet is `Fin d` and `n ≤ d`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.coeff_eq_coeff_partWeight`: a symmetric polynomial has the same coefficient at a
  monomial of degree `n` and at the sorted monomial of the partition of its exponents.
* `TauCeti.partWeightCoeff_bijective`: **a symmetric homogeneous polynomial is exactly a
  prescription of coefficients at the sorted monomials**.
* `TauCeti.coe_msymmBasis` and `TauCeti.msymmBasis_repr_apply`: the monomial basis consists of the
  monomial symmetric polynomials, and coordinates in it are coefficients at sorted monomials.
* `TauCeti.msymmBasis_repr_schurPoly`: **the Kostka numbers are the change-of-basis matrix**, the
  coordinates of `s_μ` in the monomial basis.
* `TauCeti.schurPolyBasis` and `TauCeti.coe_schurPolyBasis`: **the Schur polynomials of the
  partitions of `n` with at most `Fintype.card σ` parts are a basis of the symmetric homogeneous
  polynomials of degree `n`.**
