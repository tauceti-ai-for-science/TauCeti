# The monomial expansion of a Schur polynomial

The Schur polynomial `s_μ` is a sum of one monomial per semistandard tableau, so its coefficient at
an exponent vector `d` is the Kostka number counting the tableaux of shape `μ` and content `d`
(`TauCeti.coeff_schurPoly`).  That content is a *function* on the alphabet, while the Kostka
numbers `TauCeti.kostkaNumber` are indexed by a *partition*: the two differ by sorting the
exponents into decreasing order.  This file closes that gap and reads off the expansion of a Schur
polynomial in the monomial symmetric polynomials `MvPolynomial.msymm`,

`s_μ = ∑_{ν ⊢ n} K_{μν} m_ν`,

with the Kostka numbers as its coefficients.

The bridge is the symmetry of `s_μ`.  Sorting the exponents of a monomial is a permutation of the
alphabet, and a permutation of the alphabet does not change the coefficients of a symmetric
polynomial, so the coefficient of `s_μ` at an arbitrary exponent vector of total degree `n` is its
coefficient at the sorted one, which `TauCeti.coeff_schurPoly_partWeight` already computes as a
Kostka number.  Concretely, `TauCeti.weightPartition` records the multiset of nonzero exponents of
a monomial, `TauCeti.exists_perm_mapDomain_eq_partWeight` produces the permutation that sorts them,
and `TauCeti.coeff_schurPoly_eq_kostkaNumber` is the resulting coefficient formula.

The sum runs over *all* partitions of `n`, with no bound relating the number of parts of `ν` to the
size of the alphabet: a partition with more parts than the alphabet has letters contributes nothing
because its monomial symmetric polynomial vanishes there (`TauCeti.msymm_eq_zero_of_card_lt`),
exactly as the Schur polynomial itself vanishes for such a shape
(`TauCeti.schurPoly_eq_zero_iff`).

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.weightSym`: the multiset of letters of a monomial of total degree `n`, as an element of
  `Sym σ n`.
* `TauCeti.weightPartition`: the partition of `n` recording the multiset of nonzero exponents of a
  monomial of total degree `n`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.exists_perm_mapDomain_eq_partWeight`: a monomial of total degree `n` is a permutation of
  the alphabet away from the sorted monomial `TauCeti.partWeight` of its
  `TauCeti.weightPartition`.
* `TauCeti.coeff_msymm`: a monomial symmetric polynomial has coefficient `1` at the monomials of
  its shape and `0` at every other monomial, and `TauCeti.msymm_eq_zero_of_card_lt`: it vanishes in
  an alphabet with fewer letters than its partition has parts.
* `TauCeti.coeff_schurPoly_eq_kostkaNumber`: **the coefficient of `s_μ` at any monomial of degree
  `n` is a Kostka number**, that of `μ` and the partition of the monomial's exponents.
* `TauCeti.schurPoly_eq_sum_kostkaNumber_smul_msymm`: **the monomial expansion**
  `s_μ = ∑_ν K_{μν} m_ν`, writing a Schur polynomial as the combination of the monomial symmetric
  polynomials whose coefficients are the Kostka numbers.  This is the expansion only: neither family
  is linearly independent as indexed here, both containing zero terms whenever the partition has
  more parts than the alphabet has letters.  Restricted to the partitions the alphabet does record
  they *are* bases, and the Kostka numbers a genuine change-of-basis matrix, which is
  `TauCeti/RingTheory/MvPolynomial/Symmetric/Schur/Basis.lean`.
* `TauCeti.degree_partWeight`, `TauCeti.weightPartition_partWeight` and
  `TauCeti.coeff_msymm_partWeight`: the sorted monomial of a partition the alphabet records has
  degree `n` and shape that partition, so `m_ν` is the indicator of its own sorted monomial.  This
  is what makes the monomial symmetric polynomials independent.
* `TauCeti.isHomogeneous_msymm`: a monomial symmetric polynomial is homogeneous.

## Implementation notes

One general fact is used and kept `private` here rather than stated for its own sake: that two
families on a finite type taking the same multiset of values differ by a permutation of the index
type.  It is the shape of the sorting argument in this file and has no other consumer yet.
