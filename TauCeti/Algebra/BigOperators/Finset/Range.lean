# Range reindexing for finite sums

Generic identities for sums indexed by `Finset.range` and `Finset.Ioo`. These are used by
coderivation/Taylor expansions, which reindex a cut-and-collapse double sum over a triangle to a
square and enlarge a vanishing-off-the-block range, and by divided-power exponential calculations,
which reindex a sum over antidiagonals to a rectangle.

## Main results

* `sum_Ioo_eq_sum_range`: a sum over `Ioo 0 n` equals the sum over `range n` when the summand at
  `0` vanishes.
* `sum_range_triangle`: summing over pairs `(c, p - c)` with `c ≤ p < K` equals the square
  `range K × range K` when the family vanishes off the triangle.
* `sum_range_add_antidiagonal_of_support`: a sum over antidiagonals below `k + l` equals
  the rectangle `range k × range l` when the summand vanishes outside that rectangle.
* `sum_sum_range_eq_of_eq_zero_right`: enlarging both ranges of a double sum that vanishes outside
  a rectangle.
* `sum_range_eq_of_eq_zero_off_pair` and `sum_range_eq_of_eq_zero_off_triple`: convenient
  specializations to supports of size two and three.
* `sum_range_add_add`: splitting a `range n` sum into a prefix, a block, and a suffix.
* `sum_range_min_add_two`: the two-step recurrence satisfied by the sums
  `∑_{i ≤ min j r} c^i a (j + r − 2i)`.
* `sum_range_min_zero`: the base case `j = 0` of that recurrence, which its `j + 1` cannot state.
* `two_mul_sum_range_pair`: twice the sum of the products over the pairs `i < j < k` is the
  square of the sum minus the sum of the squares.

/-! ### The two-step recurrence of the sums `∑_{i ≤ min j r} c^i a (j + r − 2i)` -/

/-- **A two-step recurrence for the sums `S j r = ∑_{i ≤ min j r} c^i a (j + r − 2i)`**:
`S (j+2) (r+1) + c · S j (r+1) = S (j+1) (r+2) + c · S (j+1) r`.

This is the identity the Fourier coefficients of the Hecke operators at a prime power satisfy
(`TauCeti/NumberTheory/ModularForms/HeckeSlash/Nebentypus/Prime/Power.lean`), with `a t` the
coefficient at `p^t m` and `c = χ(p) p^{k−1}`; the `min` is what makes it hold with no relation
between `j` and `r`. -/
