# Complexes of projective modules over a principal ideal domain

Let `K` be a homological complex of modules over a principal ideal ring `k` without zero divisors,
of any shape.  Every module injecting into a projective `k`-module is free
(`Module.Free.of_injective_of_projective_of_isPrincipalIdealRing`).  So when the term `Kᵢ` is
projective, its cycles `Zᵢ` are free, hence projective.  When the term `Kⱼ` after `Kᵢ` is
projective, the boundaries `Bⱼ ⊆ Kⱼ` are projective, so the short exact sequence
`0 ⟶ Zᵢ ⟶ Kᵢ ⟶ Bⱼ ⟶ 0` splits and the cycles split off `Kᵢ`.

These are the hypotheses of the universal coefficient sequence
(`TauCeti.ChainComplex.exact_extToHomology_kronecker`), so it applies to every complex of free
abelian groups, for instance to singular chains with integer coefficients.  The splitting of
complexes (`HomologicalComplex.exists_homotopyEquiv_d_eq_zero`) additionally needs the homology to
split off the cycles, which holds when the homology is projective
(`HomologicalComplex.isSplitEpi_homologyπ_of_projective`).  Over a field the cycles split off for
the simpler reason that all modules are semisimple (`TauCeti.Algebra.Homology.Semisimple`).

## Main results

* `HomologicalComplex.free_cycles_of_isPrincipalIdealRing`: the cycles of a projective term are
  free.
* `HomologicalComplex.isSplitMono_iCycles_of_isPrincipalIdealRing`: the cycles split off a term
  when the next term is projective.

## References

* C. Weibel, *An Introduction to Homological Algebra*, Section 3.6, where the same splitting
  gives the Künneth and universal coefficient theorems for complexes of free abelian groups.
