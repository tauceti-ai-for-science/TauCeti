# The Ext-Euler characteristic from a finite projective resolution

Let `C` be a `k`-linear abelian category. A finite projective resolution

```text
0 ⟶ Pₙ ⟶ ⋯ ⟶ P₁ ⟶ P₀ ⟶ X ⟶ 0
```

computes the Ext-Euler characteristic against `Y` as the alternating Hom dimension

```text
χ(X, Y) = ∑ i, (-1)ⁱ dimₖ Hom(Pᵢ, Y).
```

The hypotheses are conditions on the object property `P` along which the resolution is taken:
every object satisfying `P` is projective and has a finite-dimensional Hom space into `Y`.
Projectivity makes the higher `Ext` groups of the resolving terms vanish, and bounds the
projective dimension of `X` by the length of the resolution. The long exact Ext sequence then
proves, from the far end of the resolution towards `X`, both that `(X, Y)` is Euler-admissible
and that the displayed formula holds.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.ExactStructure.FiniteResolution.homEuler`: the alternating Hom dimension of the terms
  of a finite resolution.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.ExactStructure.FiniteResolution.hasProjectiveDimensionLT`: a finite resolution by
  projectives bounds the projective dimension of the resolved object by its length.
* `TauCeti.ExactStructure.FiniteResolution.isExtBoundedBy`: a finite resolution by projectives
  makes the `Ext` groups vanish from degree `r.length + 1` on.
* `TauCeti.ExactStructure.FiniteResolution.isExtFinite`: `Ext`-finiteness propagates along a
  finite resolution from its resolving terms to the resolved object. Together with the previous
  result it gives `TauCeti.ExactStructure.FiniteResolution.isEulerAdmissible`.
* `TauCeti.ExactStructure.FiniteResolution.extEuler_eq_homEuler`: the Ext-Euler characteristic of
  a pair resolved by a Hom-finite finite projective resolution is the alternating Hom dimension of
  that resolution.
* `TauCeti.ExactStructure.FiniteResolution.homEuler_eq_homEuler`: any two finite resolutions of
  `X`, along object properties consisting of projectives with finite-dimensional Hom spaces into
  `Y`, have the same alternating Hom dimension.

/-- The alternating Hom dimension of a finite resolution against `Y`:
`dim Hom(P₀,Y) - dim Hom(P₁,Y) + ⋯ + (-1)ⁿ dim Hom(Pₙ,Y)`.

As with `TauCeti.truncatedExtEuler`, this definition is total: `Module.finrank` has its usual
zero fallback when a Hom space is not finite-dimensional. The theorems below assume Hom-finiteness,
so every summand there is an actual dimension. -/
