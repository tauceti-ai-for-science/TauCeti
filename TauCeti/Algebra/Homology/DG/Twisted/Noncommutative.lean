# Twisted complexes: a noncommutative regression test

The twisted differential of `TauCeti.Algebra.Homology.DG.Twisted.Complex` multiplies the
coefficients of a twisting cocycle through the right action of the algebra.  Over a commutative
algebra the order of the factors is invisible; this file checks the construction on the smallest
noncommutative example in which it matters.

The algebra is the path algebra `ℚ⟨a, b, c⟩` of the quiver with one vertex and three loops, graded
by `|a| = |b| = 0` and `|c| = -1` (cohomologically), with the differential `∂a = ∂b = 0` and
`∂c = -ab`, extended as a graded derivation.  Three generators `x, z, y` of indices `2, 1, 0`
carry the coefficients `m x z = a`, `m z y = b` and `m x y = c`.  The twisting equation reads
`∂c = -ab` and holds; the matrix is one-sided.

On the regular module `A` with its right action, the twisted differential sends `1 ⊗ x` to
`a ⊗ z + c ⊗ y`, then `a ⊗ z` to `ab ⊗ y` and `c ⊗ y` to `-ab ⊗ y`, so `D² (1 ⊗ x) = 0` on the
nose (`twistedDifferential_twistedDifferential_single_x`).  The cancellation is between `ab`,
produced by the right action of `b` on `a`, and `∂c = -ab`; the products `ab` and `ba` are distinct
basis paths (`gen_a_mul_gen_b_ne`), so it depends on the order in which the construction
multiplies the coefficients.  The literal right-free reading of the same coefficients,
`d e_x = Σ_y e_y m x y`, in which the twisting coefficient multiplies the coordinate `f x` on the
left, is recorded as
`rightFreeOperator`: it gives `d² e_x = e_y (ba - ab) ≠ 0`
(`rightFreeOperator_rightFreeOperator_single_x_ne_zero`), which is the reason for the
variance convention of the twisted complex.

## Main definitions and results

* `TauCeti.TwistedExamples.threeDegree`, `TauCeti.TwistedExamples.threeRelator`: the degrees of the
  three arrows and the values of the differential on them;
  `TauCeti.TwistedExamples.isDGAlgebra_threeDifferential` makes `ℚ⟨a, b, c⟩` a differential graded
  algebra.
* `TauCeti.TwistedExamples.threeCocycle`: the twisting cocycle `m x z = a`, `m z y = b`,
  `m x y = c`, with its entries `threeCocycle_m_apply`.
* `TauCeti.TwistedExamples.twistedDifferential_single_x`: `D (1 ⊗ x) = a ⊗ z + c ⊗ y`.
* `TauCeti.TwistedExamples.twistedDifferential_twistedDifferential_single_x`: `D² (1 ⊗ x) = 0`,
  computed term by term.
* `TauCeti.TwistedExamples.gen_a_mul_gen_b_ne`: `ab ≠ ba` in the path algebra.
* `TauCeti.TwistedExamples.rightFreeOperator`: the literal right-free reading of the
  coefficients, with `rightFreeOperator_rightFreeOperator_single_x_ne_zero`: its square
  does not vanish on `e_x`, so it is not a differential.

/-! ### The literal right-free reading

Reading the coefficients as a differential on a free right module, `d e_x = Σ_y e_y m x y`, puts
the twisting coefficient between the basis vector and its coordinate: on `Fin 3 → ℚ⟨a, b, c⟩`,
`(d f) y = ∂ (f y) + Σ_x m x y * f x`, so `m x y` multiplies the coordinate `f x` on the left.  Its
square does not vanish. -/
