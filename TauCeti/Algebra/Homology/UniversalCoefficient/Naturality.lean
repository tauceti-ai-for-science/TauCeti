# Naturality of the universal coefficient sequence

The inclusion of `Ext¹(Hⱼ(X), Y)` into the cohomology of `Hom(X, Y)` commutes with
pullback along chain maps and pushforward along coefficient morphisms. Together with
naturality of the Kronecker map, this makes both arrows of the universal coefficient
sequence natural in both variables.
No compatibility of chosen cycle retractions is needed.
