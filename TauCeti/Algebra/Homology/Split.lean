# Split complexes are homotopy equivalent to complexes with zero differential

Let `K` be a homological complex, of any shape, in an abelian category.  Write `Zᵢ` for its cycles
and `Hᵢ` for its homology.  Suppose that in every degree the inclusion `Zᵢ ⟶ Kᵢ` of the cycles is
a split monomorphism and the projection `Zᵢ ⟶ Hᵢ` onto the homology is a split epimorphism.  Then
`K` is chain homotopy equivalent to the complex with terms `Hᵢ` and zero differentials
(`HomologicalComplex.exists_homotopyEquiv_d_eq_zero`).

Both hypotheses hold for every complex of vector spaces, and more generally of semisimple modules
(see `TauCeti.Algebra.Homology.Semisimple`).  The second holds whenever the homology objects are
projective (`HomologicalComplex.isSplitEpi_homologyπ_of_projective`).  The first holds for a
complex of projective modules over a principal ideal domain, since the image of the differential
out of `Kᵢ` is then projective (`HomologicalComplex.isSplitMono_iCycles_of_isPrincipalIdealRing`);
mathematically, the same argument works over any hereditary ring.  The result therefore reduces
statements about the homology of such complexes, such as the Künneth theorem, to complexes with
zero differential.

The construction is the classical splitting.  Choose a retraction `r : Kᵢ ⟶ Zᵢ` of the inclusion
`ι : Zᵢ ⟶ Kᵢ` and a section `s : Hᵢ ⟶ Zᵢ` of the projection `π : Zᵢ ⟶ Hᵢ`.  The chain maps are
`s ≫ ι : Hᵢ ⟶ Kᵢ` and `r ≫ π : Kᵢ ⟶ Hᵢ`, and their composite on `H` is the identity.  For a
relation `j → i` of the shape, the differential `Kⱼ ⟶ Kᵢ` corestricts to an epimorphism onto the
boundaries `Bᵢ = ker π` with kernel `Zⱼ`, so it is the cokernel of `Zⱼ ⟶ Kⱼ`.  The idempotent
`𝟙 - r ≫ ι` of `Kⱼ` kills `Zⱼ` and therefore factors through `Bᵢ`; the resulting map `Bᵢ ⟶ Kⱼ`
inverts the differential on the complement of the cycles.  Precomposing it with the
`Bᵢ`-component `r ≫ (𝟙 - π ≫ s)` of `Kᵢ` gives the homotopy `h : Kᵢ ⟶ Kⱼ`, with
`𝟙 - (r ≫ π) ≫ (s ≫ ι) = d h + h d`.

## Main results

* `HomologicalComplex.exists_homotopyEquiv_d_eq_zero`: a complex whose cycles split off and whose
  homology splits off its cycles is homotopy equivalent to a complex with zero differentials.
* `HomologicalComplex.isSplitEpi_homologyπ_of_projective`: the projection onto a projective
  homology object splits.
