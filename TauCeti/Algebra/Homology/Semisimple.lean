# Complexes of semisimple modules split

Let `K` be a homological complex of modules over a ring `R`, of any shape, whose terms are
semisimple modules; for instance any complex of vector spaces over a division ring, or of modules
over a semisimple ring.  Every submodule of a semisimple module is a direct summand, and every
submodule and quotient of a semisimple module is semisimple.  So in every degree the inclusion of
the cycles is a split monomorphism and the projection of the cycles onto the homology is a split
epimorphism.

By `HomologicalComplex.exists_homotopyEquiv_d_eq_zero`, `K` is therefore chain homotopy equivalent
to a complex with zero differentials, whose terms are the homology of `K`: over a division ring
every complex is homotopy equivalent to its homology.  This reduces statements about the homology
of complexes of vector spaces, such as the Künneth theorem over a field, to complexes with zero
differential.

## Main results

* `HomologicalComplex.isSplitMono_iCycles_of_isSemisimpleModule`: the cycles of a semisimple term
  split off.
* `HomologicalComplex.isSplitEpi_homologyπ_of_isSemisimpleModule`: the homology in a degree with
  semisimple term splits off the cycles.
