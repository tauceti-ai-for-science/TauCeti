# The weight decomposition of a comodule over a monoid algebra

Let `R[G]` be the monoid algebra of a type `G` over a commutative semiring `R`. Its coalgebra
structure makes every `single g 1` a group-like element. This file proves that a right
`R[G]`-comodule `V` is the internal direct sum of its weight submodules

`weightSpace R G V g = {v | ρ v = v ⊗ single g 1}`,

each of which is a subcomodule. When `G` is a commutative group, `R[G]` is the coordinate Hopf
algebra of the diagonalizable group `D(G)`, and this says that its representations decompose into
character spaces.

The proof is the classical one and uses nothing beyond the comodule axioms. Writing the coaction
of `v` as `ρ v = ∑ g, v g ⊗ single g 1`, which is possible because `R[G]` is free on the
group-like elements, the counit axiom says that the coefficients sum to `v` and coassociativity
says that the `h`-coefficient of `v g` is `v g` when `h = g` and `0` otherwise. The coefficient
maps are therefore orthogonal idempotents with images the weight submodules, which gives both the
spanning and the independence half of the decomposition.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.Comodule.tensorCoeffEquiv`: the coefficients of an element of `V ⊗[R] R[G]`, as a
  finitely supported family.
* `TauCeti.Comodule.weightDecomposition`: the weight components of a comodule, as a linear map to
  finitely supported families.
* `TauCeti.Comodule.weightProj`: the projection onto the `g`-weight component.
* `TauCeti.Comodule.weightSpace`: the `g`-weight submodule, where the coaction is `v ↦ v ⊗ g`.
* `TauCeti.Comodule.weightSubcomodule`: the weight submodule as a subcomodule.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.Comodule.weightDecomposition_sum`: the weight components of a vector sum to it.
* `TauCeti.Comodule.weightProj_weightProj_self` and
  `TauCeti.Comodule.weightProj_weightProj_of_ne`: the weight projections are orthogonal
  idempotents.
* `TauCeti.Comodule.weightProj_mem_weightSpace`: each weight component lies in its weight
  submodule.
* `TauCeti.Comodule.isInternal_weightSpace`: **a comodule over a monoid algebra is the internal
  direct sum of its weight submodules.**
* `TauCeti.Comodule.endOfPoint_tmul_of_mem_weightSpace`: an algebra map out of `R[G]` acts on the
  `g`-weight submodule by multiplication by its value at the group-like element `single g 1`.
* `TauCeti.Comodule.Hom.map_mem_weightSpace`: a comodule morphism preserves the weight
  submodules.
* `TauCeti.Comodule.weightProj_mem_subcomodule`: every subcomodule is stable under the weight
  projections.
* `TauCeti.Comodule.range_weightProj`: the `g`-weight submodule is the range of the `g`-weight
  projection.
* `TauCeti.Comodule.finite_setOf_weightSpace_ne_bot`: **a comodule finitely generated as a module
  has only finitely many weights.**

## Implementation notes

Only the coalgebra structure of `R[G]` is used, so `G` is an arbitrary type: no multiplication on
`G` and no algebra structure on `R[G]` enter the argument. That `R[G]` is free on `G` is used
through `TensorProduct.finsuppScalarRight`, which presents `V ⊗[R] R[G]` as the finitely supported
functions `G →₀ V` and so supplies the finite support of the weight decomposition for free; this is
also the only place where decidable equality on `G` is used internally, and it is discharged
classically.

## References

For a commutative group `G`, this specializes to the standard statement that representations of a
diagonalizable group are diagonalizable; see Waterhouse, *Introduction to Affine Group Schemes*,
§3.2, and Milne, *Algebraic Groups* (2017), Theorem 12.12.

It supplies a prerequisite for the Tau Ceti reductive-groups roadmap, `ReductiveGroups/README.md`
in TauCetiRoadmap: Layer 6 asks for the linear reductivity of tori ("over an algebraically closed
field of characteristic `p`, a connected group is linearly reductive iff it is a torus"), of which
this is the substantive direction for a split torus, and Layer 7's root datum of a split pair
`(G, T)` is read off the weight decomposition of `Lie G` under `T` that this file provides. The
diagonalizable group `D(G) = Spec R[G]` itself is in
`TauCeti.Algebra.AlgebraicGroup.DiagonalizableGroup.Basic`.

/-- **A comodule over `R[G]` that is finitely generated as a module has only finitely many
weights.**

For a representation of the diagonalizable group `D(G)` this is the finiteness of its set of
weights, and for the adjoint representation of an affine group scheme under a split torus it is
the finiteness of the set of roots. -/
