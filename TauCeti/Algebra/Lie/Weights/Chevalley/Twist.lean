# Rescaling a normalised system against an automorphism inverting the Cartan subalgebra

Let `L` be a finite-dimensional Lie algebra with non-degenerate Killing form over a field `K` of
characteristic zero, let `H` be a splitting Cartan subalgebra, and let `ω` be a Lie automorphism of
`L` acting by `-1` on `H`. Such an `ω` inverts every weight, so it carries the root space of `α`
onto the root space of `-α`; since those spaces are lines, a normalised family `x` of root vectors
is scaled by `ω`:

```text
ω (x α) = c α • x (-α).
```

A **Chevalley system** is the special case `c ≡ -1`, which is what
`TauCeti.IsSl2System.isChevalleyNormalized_iff_exists_isChevalleySystem` shows to be the same thing
as having the Chevalley integers `±(p + 1)` as structure constants. The family in hand need not
satisfy `c ≡ -1`, and this file is about what has to be true for a rescaling of it to.

Two facts govern the scalars, and both are proved here.

*They are almost multiplicative.* Applying `ω` to `⁅x α, x β⁆ = N(α, β) • x γ` for `γ = α + β`
gives

```text
c γ * N(α, β) = c α * c β * N(-α, -β),
```

and multiplying by `N(α, β)` turns the right-hand factor into the invariant
`N(α, β) N(-α, -β) = -(p + 1)²` of
`TauCeti.IsSl2System.structureConstant_mul_structureConstant_neg_neg`. So `-c γ` differs from
`(-c α) (-c β)` by the square `((p + 1) / N(α, β))²`, and the integrality of
`N(α, β)` is *exactly* the equation `c γ = -(c α * c β)`. In particular the square class of `-c α`
is multiplicative along root sums, which is the induction step of a reduction to the simple
roots.

*Square roots of them rescale the family.* Rescaling `x α` to `s α • x α` preserves the
normalisation exactly when `s α * s (-α) = 1`, and it multiplies `c α` by `s α ^ 2`. So `c α` can be
moved to `-1` precisely when `-c α` is a square, and choosing one root out of each opposite pair
with `TauCeti.exists_rootPairRepresentatives` makes the rescaling factors used at `α` and `-α`
inverse to each other. This is
`TauCeti.IsSl2System.exists_isChevalleySystem_of_forall_exists_sq`.

Together these reduce the existence of a Chevalley system for a given `ω` to the statement that
`-c α` is a square at every root, and make that statement multiplicative along root sums. Two
things are deliberately left out. The automorphism `ω` is an input and is not produced here; and no
induction over root heights is carried out, so the reduction of the square condition from all roots
to a base is available as a step and is not taken. Carter builds a Chevalley basis by a different
route, a sign recursion over the extraspecial pairs enumerated in
`TauCeti/LinearAlgebra/RootSystem/ExtraspecialPair.lean`; going through an automorphism is the
route Bourbaki's definition of a Chevalley system suggests, and it is the one available when the
Chevalley involution is already visible on a presentation of `L`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.IsSl2System.ne_zero_of_map_eq_smul_neg`: a scalar by which the automorphism moves a root
  vector is nonzero.
* `TauCeti.IsSl2System.mul_eq_one_of_map_eq_smul_neg`: the scalars at `α` and `-α` are inverse.
* `TauCeti.IsSl2System.mul_structureConstant_eq_of_map_eq_smul_neg`: the multiplicativity relation
  along a root sum.
* `TauCeti.IsSl2System.structureConstant_eq_natCast_or_eq_neg_natCast_iff_of_map_eq_smul_neg`: a
  structure constant is a Chevalley integer exactly when the scalars multiply up to the expected
  sign.
* `TauCeti.IsSl2System.neg_eq_mul_sq_of_map_eq_smul_neg` and
  `TauCeti.IsSl2System.isSquare_neg_of_map_eq_smul_neg`: the square class of `-c α` is
  multiplicative along root sums.
* `TauCeti.IsSl2System.exists_sq_map_eq_smul_neg_of_isSquare`: the bridge from that square-class
  statement to a square-root form of the root-vector equation.
* `TauCeti.IsSl2System.exists_isChevalleySystem_of_forall_exists_sq`: if every `-c α` is a square,
  the family rescales to a Chevalley system for `ω`.

## Roadmap

Layer 9 of `TauCetiRoadmap/ReductiveGroups/README.md` builds the split reductive group scheme over
`ℤ` "via a Chevalley basis and the Kostant `ℤ`-form of the enveloping algebra", and
`TauCeti.IsChevalleySystem` is that Chevalley basis. Everything downstream of it —
`TauCeti.IsChevalleySystem.chevalleyLieLattice`, the adjoint admissible lattice, and the adjoint
elementary Chevalley group — takes one as a hypothesis, so producing one is the open step. This
file supplies the route through an automorphism inverting the Cartan subalgebra. Milestone L0 of
`TauCetiRoadmap/CFSGStatement/README.md` is the downstream consumer of the assembled pinned group
scheme.

/-- **A normalised family rescales to a Chevalley system when the negated scalars are squares.**
Writing `ω (x α) = c α • x (-α)`, the hypothesis is that `-c α` is a square at every root; the
conclusion is a normalised family `y` with `ω (y α) = -y (-α)`, that is, a Chevalley system for the
given automorphism.

The constraint `c α * c (-α) = 1` forces the chosen square roots to satisfy
`t α ^ 2 * t (-α) ^ 2 = 1`. Choosing one root from each opposite pair with
`TauCeti.exists_rootPairRepresentatives` then makes the rescaling factors used at `α` and `-α`
inverse, which keeps the normalisation `⁅y α, y (-α)⁆ = α^∨` intact. -/
