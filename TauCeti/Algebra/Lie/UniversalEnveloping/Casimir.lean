# The Casimir element of a universal enveloping algebra

Let `L` be a finite-dimensional Lie algebra over a field `K` whose Killing form `κ` is
nondegenerate.  Choosing a basis `x₁, …, xₙ` of `L` and the basis `y₁, …, yₙ` dual to it under `κ`,
the **Casimir element** is

`Ω = ∑ᵢ xᵢ yᵢ ∈ U(L)`,

a distinguished element of the universal enveloping algebra.  In the classical setting of a split
semisimple Lie algebra in characteristic zero it is the source of Weyl's complete reducibility
theorem: it is central, so it acts on any module by a module endomorphism, and on a highest weight
module by a scalar that separates the trivial module from the others.  Those extra hypotheses are
needed only for that application; centrality, the statement proved here, needs nothing beyond a
nondegenerate Killing form.

Two facts make `Ω` an invariant of `L` rather than of the chosen basis. They are developed in
`TauCeti.Algebra.Lie.Killing.DualBasis` and applied here.

* `Ω` does not depend on the basis.  The mechanism is `TauCeti.sum_apply_killingDualBasis_eq`:
  for *every* `K`-bilinear map `f` out of `L × L`, the value `∑ᵢ f xᵢ yᵢ` is the same for all
  bases, because expanding one basis in the other exchanges the two dual bases.  The Casimir
  element is the instance `f x y = x * y` in `U(L)`, so `TauCeti.casimirElement_eq_sum` computes
  it from any basis at all, and the chosen basis in the definition is immaterial.
* `Ω` is central (`TauCeti.casimirElement_mem_center`).  The same bilinear mechanism gives
  `TauCeti.sum_apply_lie_killingDualBasis_add_eq_zero`, the statement that the element
  `∑ᵢ xᵢ ⊗ yᵢ` is annihilated by the adjoint action of `L`; this is exactly the invariance
  `κ ⁅z, x⁆ y = -κ x ⁅z, y⁆` of the Killing form, summed.  Feeding it the commutator identity
  `ι z * ι x - ι x * ι z = ι ⁅z, x⁆` turns it into `ι z * Ω = Ω * ι z`, and the canonical Lie
  generators generate `U(L)` (`TauCeti.UniversalEnvelopingAlgebra.adjoin_range_ι`), so `Ω`
  commutes with everything.

Only nondegeneracy, symmetry and invariance of the Killing form are used, so the argument below
would go through for any invariant nondegenerate symmetric form once the definitions and lemmas
are parameterised by such a form; as written they are stated for the Killing form, which is the
canonical choice this development needs and the one the roadmap pins.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.casimirElement`: the Casimir element of `U(L)`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.sum_killingForm_killingDualBasis_eq_trace`: the sum `∑ᵢ κ (p xᵢ) yᵢ` is the trace of the
  endomorphism `p`.
* `TauCeti.sum_apply_killingDualBasis_of_isAdjointPair`: a pair of endomorphisms adjoint for the
  Killing form may be moved from the first slot of `f` to the second.
* `TauCeti.casimirElement_eq_sum`: the Casimir element is `∑ᵢ xᵢ yᵢ` for **any** basis `x` of `L`
  and its Killing-dual basis `y`, so the basis chosen in the definition does not matter.
* `TauCeti.representation_casimirElement_apply_eq_zero_of_isTrivial`: the Casimir element acts by
  zero on a module with trivial Lie action.
* `TauCeti.ι_mul_casimirElement`: the Casimir element commutes with every canonical Lie generator.
* `TauCeti.representation_casimirElement_lie`: the Casimir operator of a module commutes with the
  Lie action.
* `TauCeti.map_representation_casimirElement`: a homomorphism of Lie modules intertwines the
  Casimir operators.
* `TauCeti.casimirElement_mem_center`: **the Casimir element is central in `U(L)`.**

The remaining statement about `casimirElement`, that it acts on a highest weight module of weight
`λ` by the scalar `⟨λ + ρ, λ + ρ⟩ - ⟨ρ, ρ⟩`, is not proved here but in
`TauCeti/Algebra/Lie/HighestWeight/Casimir.lean`, which is where the highest weight vectors and the
invariant form on weights that it is phrased in are available.

  element"), Proposition 11: given an invariant bilinear form whose restriction to an ideal `a` is
  nondegenerate, the element `c = Σᵢ eᵢ eᵢ'` built from a basis of `a` and the dual basis of `a`
  is independent of that basis and commutes with the whole Lie algebra.  Taking `a` to be all of
  `L` and the form to be the Killing form gives the two statements proved here; Bourbaki is
  strictly more general, since the form may be degenerate on `L` and the sum then runs over a basis
  of the proper ideal `a`, which is beyond the generality noted above.

  the Casimir element of the trace form of a faithful representation of a semisimple Lie algebra;
  the Killing form is the case of the adjoint representation.
