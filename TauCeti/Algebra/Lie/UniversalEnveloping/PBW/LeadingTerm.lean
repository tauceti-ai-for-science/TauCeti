# Permuting PBW words modulo lower filtration

This file proves the first consequence of the defining relation of a universal enveloping algebra
for its associated graded. If two words in the canonical generators differ only by a permutation,
then their difference has filtration degree strictly below their common word length. In particular,
the leading term of a word is unchanged when the word is sorted.

An adjacent exchange is the mathematical heart of the proof:

```text
ι(x) * ι(y) - ι(y) * ι(x) = ι([x,y]).
```

The left side has word length two while the right side has word length one. Multiplying by the
unchanged suffix preserves this one-degree drop. Induction on `List.Perm` then gives the result for
an arbitrary permutation.

## Main definitions and results

* `TauCeti.UniversalEnvelopingAlgebra.pbwMonomial`: the product of a word in a chosen family of
  Lie-algebra elements.
* `TauCeti.UniversalEnvelopingAlgebra.map_pbwMonomial`: induced maps act factorwise on PBW
  monomials.
* `TauCeti.UniversalEnvelopingAlgebra.prod_map_ι_sub_prod_map_ι_mem_pbwFiltrationPrevious_of_perm`:
  permuted words in canonical generators differ by a lower-filtration term.
* `pbwMonomial_sub_pbwMonomial_mem_pbwFiltrationPrevious_of_perm`:
  the same statement for words in an indexed family.
* `TauCeti.UniversalEnvelopingAlgebra.pbwMonomial_sub_insertionSort_mem_pbwFiltrationPrevious`:
  every word has the same leading term as its ordered version.

This is the first part of the associated-graded-map target in Layer 3, "PBW, a substantial
sub-project", of `TauCetiRoadmap/RepresentationTheory/LieHighestWeight/README.md`. The next stage
uses these permutation-invariant leading terms to define the map from `SymmetricAlgebra R L` to the
associated graded of `U(L)`.
