# Central `p`-polynomials in a universal enveloping algebra

Let `R` be a commutative ring of exponential characteristic `p` and `L` a Lie `R`-algebra.  A
*linearized polynomial*, or `p`-polynomial, in an element `u` of an `R`-algebra is an `R`-linear
combination of the Frobenius powers `u ^ p ^ i`; it is *monic of degree `p ^ e`* when the
coefficient of `u ^ p ^ e` is `1` and no higher power occurs, and it has *zero constant term*
when the exponent `p ^ 0 = 1` is the smallest one allowed, so that the polynomial is divisible
by `u`.

The theorem of this file is that, as soon as `Module.End R L` is a Noetherian `R`-module — over a
field, as soon as `L` is finite-dimensional — every `x : L` admits such a polynomial in `ι x` that
is central in `U(L)`, and that it automatically lies in the augmentation ideal `U⁺(L)`.  These
elements are Hochschild's central `p`-polynomials: the commutative subalgebra they generate makes
`U(L)` a finite module over a Noetherian commutative ring, and the two-sided ideal they generate
is what the Krull intersection theorem is eventually applied to.

Two ingredients drive the proof, and neither needs the Poincaré-Birkhoff-Witt theorem.

* `LieAlgebra.ad R L x` lives in `Module.End R L`, and as soon as that module is Noetherian the
  chain of submodules spanned by the initial segments of the sequence
  `(LieAlgebra.ad R L x ^ p ^ i)` cannot grow forever.  The first repetition is a monic linearized
  relation.  Over a field this Noetherian hypothesis is finite-dimensionality of `L`, which is the
  form the theory is used in.
* The Frobenius commutator identity `TauCeti.LieAlgebra.ad_pow_expChar_pow` turns that relation
  into a statement about the inner derivation of `U(L)` attached to `ι x`: a linearized
  polynomial in an inner derivation is again a derivation, because each `p`-th power of a
  derivation is one in characteristic `p`, and here that derivation is inner, attached to the
  corresponding polynomial in `ι x`.  A derivation vanishing on the canonical Lie generators
  vanishes, so the polynomial is central.

⚠ Centrality is *not* natural for an arbitrary Lie homomorphism `f : L →ₗ⁅R⁆ L'`.  For the
abelian `L = R x` one may take the polynomial `ι x` itself, since `LieAlgebra.ad R L x = 0`; its
image in `U(L')` for `L' = ⟨x, y⟩` with `⁅x, y⁆ = y` is `ι x`, which is not central there.  What
does survive is naturality along *surjections*, where the image of `ι (L)` still generates, and
that is `TauCeti.UniversalEnvelopingAlgebra.pPolynomial_map_mem_center_of_surjective` below.

## Main statements

* `TauCeti.UniversalEnvelopingAlgebra.mem_center_of_ad_pPolynomial_eq_zero`: a monic linearized
  relation satisfied by `LieAlgebra.ad R L x` makes the corresponding polynomial in `ι x`
  central.
* `TauCeti.UniversalEnvelopingAlgebra.exists_pCentralPolynomial_of_isNoetherian`: over a
  commutative ring, every element has such a polynomial as soon as `Module.End R L` is
  Noetherian.
* `TauCeti.UniversalEnvelopingAlgebra.exists_pCentralPolynomial`: the specialization to a
  finite-dimensional Lie algebra over a field of characteristic `p`.
* `TauCeti.UniversalEnvelopingAlgebra.pPolynomial_ι_mem_augmentation_toIdeal`: having zero
  constant term, it lies in the augmentation ideal.
* `TauCeti.UniversalEnvelopingAlgebra.exists_pow_ι_mem_center_of_isNilpotent_ad`: if
  `LieAlgebra.ad R L x` is nilpotent the polynomial may be taken to be a single Frobenius power
  `ι x ^ p ^ e`.
* `TauCeti.UniversalEnvelopingAlgebra.isNilpotent_ad_ι_of_isNilpotent_ad`: in that situation
  `LieAlgebra.ad R U(L) (ι x)` is itself nilpotent.
* `TauCeti.UniversalEnvelopingAlgebra.pPolynomial_map_mem_center_of_surjective`: centrality is
  natural along surjective Lie homomorphisms.

/-- **A monic linearized relation on `ad x` produces a central element of `U(L)`.**  If the
Frobenius powers of `LieAlgebra.ad R L x` satisfy the monic relation with coefficients `a`, then
the same linearized polynomial evaluated at the canonical Lie generator `ι x` is central in
`U(L)`.

The passage between the two is the Frobenius commutator identity: bracketing with the polynomial
in `ι x` is the corresponding polynomial in the inner derivation attached to `ι x`, which on the
Lie generators is the polynomial in `LieAlgebra.ad R L x`.  A derivation of `U(L)` vanishing on
the Lie generators vanishes. -/

/-- **Every element has a central `p`-polynomial as soon as `Module.End R L` is Noetherian.**
For `x : L` there are an exponent `e` and coefficients `a` making the monic linearized polynomial
`ι x ^ p ^ e + ∑ i, a i • ι x ^ p ^ i` central in `U(L)`.  The displayed indexing gives the
leading exponent `p ^ e` and lower exponents `p ^ i` for `i : Fin e`; it does not assert that `e`
is minimal.  Every exponent is at least `p ^ 0 = 1`, so the element also lies in the augmentation
ideal (`TauCeti.UniversalEnvelopingAlgebra.pPolynomial_ι_mem_augmentation_toIdeal`).

Noetherianity enters only through `Module.End R L`, where the Frobenius powers of
`LieAlgebra.ad R L x` cannot stay linearly independent.  Over a field this is
`TauCeti.UniversalEnvelopingAlgebra.exists_pCentralPolynomial`. -/
