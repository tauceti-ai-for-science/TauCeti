# Separability and splitting criteria for quadratic polynomials

Mathlib's `Mathlib/Algebra/QuadraticDiscriminant.lean` works with the *equation*
`a x² + b x + c = 0` and relates its solutions to `discrim a b c = b² - 4 a c`. This file reads
those facts back as statements about the *polynomial* `C a * X ^ 2 + C b * X + C c`. Wherever a
statement mentions the discriminant it uses Mathlib's `discrim` rather than its expansion, so
that Mathlib's discriminant API applies to it directly; the two criteria phrased by a root or by
an Artin-Schreier condition mention no discriminant at all.

Over an ordered commutative ring, `TauCeti.quadratic_pos_iff_of_discrim_neg` and
`TauCeti.quadratic_neg_iff_of_discrim_neg` identify the sign of a quadratic with negative
discriminant from its leading coefficient.

Over a field, with `a ≠ 0`:

* `Polynomial.separable_quadratic_iff_discrim_ne_zero`: separable exactly when `discrim a b c ≠ 0`;
* `Polynomial.splits_quadratic_iff_exists_root`: splits exactly when it has a root — the
  characteristic-free core the other two are read off from;
* `Polynomial.splits_quadratic_iff_isSquare`: away from characteristic two, splits exactly when
  `discrim a b c` is a square;
* `Polynomial.splits_quadratic_of_discrim_eq_zero`: over a perfect field, splits as soon as
  `discrim a b c = 0`;
* `Polynomial.exists_quadratic_eq_zero_and_two_mul_add_eq_zero_of_discrim_eq_zero`: over a perfect
  field, if `discrim a b c = 0` then some `x` is a root of the quadratic and of its derivative;
* `Polynomial.card_rootSet_quadratic_of_discrim_eq_zero`: if it splits and `discrim a b c = 0`, it
  has exactly one root;
* `Polynomial.splits_quadratic_iff_exists_artinSchreier_of_two_eq_zero`: in characteristic two,
  where the discriminant degenerates to `b²` (`discrim_eq_sq_of_two_eq_zero`) and the square-class
  criterion says nothing, splits exactly when the
  Artin-Schreier invariant `a c / b²` lies in the image of `z ↦ z² + z`, written division-free.
  Here `b ≠ 0` is also required, which by `separable_quadratic_iff_discrim_ne_zero` is separability.

Three statements need neither a field nor `a ≠ 0`, and are stated over a commutative (semi)ring:
`Polynomial.derivative_quadratic`, computing the derivative as `2 a X + b`; the Bézout-type
`Polynomial.sq_derivative_quadratic_sub_mul_eq_C_discrim`, `(P')² - 4 a P = C (discrim a b c)`; and
its consequence `Polynomial.separable_quadratic_of_isUnit_discrim`, that the quadratic is separable
whenever its discriminant is a unit. Over a field that last statement is one direction of
`Polynomial.separable_quadratic_iff_discrim_ne_zero`, in every characteristic.

The two splitting criteria are consumed by the node-polynomial criteria of
`TauCeti/AlgebraicGeometry/EllipticCurve/NodePolynomial.lean`, which advance
`TauCetiRoadmap/EllipticCurves/README.md` §Layer 5 (twists): whether the node polynomial of a
multiplicative reduction splits over the residue field is exactly whether that reduction is split.

`FLT/Mathlib/Algebra/Polynomial/QuadraticDiscriminant.lean` at the roadmap's pin `bc2fe8ff7396`,
FLT PR #1088, Apache 2.0). That file's own header reads `Authors: Kevin Buzzard, Claude`;
following this repository's convention for adapted material, the upstream authorship is credited
here rather than in the copyright header. Ported with the source's `@[expose]` dropped, and
without its companion `FLT/Mathlib/Algebra/Polynomial/Splits.lean`: that file's
`Splits.of_natDegree_le_two_of_isRoot` is superseded here by Mathlib's own
`Polynomial.Splits.of_natDegree_eq_two`, which the one consumer can use directly since it knows
the degree is exactly two.

/-- In characteristic two the discriminant degenerates to `b²`, since `4 = 0` kills the `a c`
