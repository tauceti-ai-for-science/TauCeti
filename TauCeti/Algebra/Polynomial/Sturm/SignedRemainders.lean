/-! # Positive-scaled signed remainder chains

The defining relations allow pseudo-remainder scaling. The terminal entry
may be nonconstant; no coprimality is imposed on the first two entries.

`Polynomial.sturmSeq` satisfies these relations. The relational formulation also
allows positive pseudo-remainder scalings without changing root sign sums.
