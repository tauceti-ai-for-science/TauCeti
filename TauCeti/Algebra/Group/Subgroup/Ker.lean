# Ranges and equality loci of group homomorphisms

This file supplies the characteristic membership equation for the subgroup equality locus, the
invariance of the range of a group homomorphism under precomposition with a surjection, and the
range and kernel of the pointwise inverse of a homomorphism into a commutative group.

## Main results

* `MonoidHom.mem_eqLocus`: membership in the equality locus is pointwise equality.
* `MonoidHom.range_comp_of_surjective`: precomposition with a surjection preserves the range.
* `MonoidHom.range_inv`, `MonoidHom.ker_inv`: the pointwise inverse `f⁻¹` has the same range and
  kernel as `f`.
