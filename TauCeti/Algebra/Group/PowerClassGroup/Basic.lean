# The group of `n`th power classes `G ⧸ Gⁿ`

For a commutative group `G` the subgroup `Gⁿ` of `n`th powers is the range of `powMonoidHom n`,
and this file names it together with the quotient `G ⧸ Gⁿ` and the class of an element. At `n = 2`
the subgroup is Mathlib's `Subgroup.square G`, by `TauCeti.square_eq_range_powMonoidHom`.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.powerSubgroup`: the subgroup `Gⁿ ≤ G`, whose elements are characterised as the `n`th
  powers by `TauCeti.mem_powerSubgroup_iff`, and which is the range of `powMonoidHom n` by
  `TauCeti.powerSubgroup_eq_range_powMonoidHom`.
* `TauCeti.powerClassQuotient`, `TauCeti.powerClassHom`: the quotient `G ⧸ Gⁿ` and the map taking
  an element to its power class. It is surjective (`TauCeti.powerClassHom_surjective`) with kernel
  `Gⁿ` (`TauCeti.ker_powerClassHom`), so it presents `G ⧸ Gⁿ` as the quotient of `G` by the `n`th
  powers.
* `Subgroup.powerSubgroup_index_le`: a subgroup of index `m` contains `Gᵐ`.
* `TauCeti.powerClassMap`: the map `G ⧸ Gⁿ → H ⧸ Hⁿ` induced by a homomorphism `G →* H`, which
  carries `n`th powers to `n`th powers. It is functorial (`TauCeti.powerClassMap_id`,
  `TauCeti.powerClassMap_comp`); for a field extension `L/K` and `f` the map `Kˣ →* Lˣ` it is the
  map of power classes along which Kummer theory is natural in the field.
