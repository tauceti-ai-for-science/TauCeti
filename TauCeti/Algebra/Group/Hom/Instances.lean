# Pre- and postcomposition with homomorphisms, as bijections on homomorphisms

For a homomorphism `f : M →* N` and a commutative monoid `P`, Mathlib's `MonoidHom.compHom' f` is
precomposition with `f`, as a homomorphism `(N →* P) →* M →* P`. This file records that it is
bijective as soon as `f` is: `Hom(-, P)` takes isomorphisms to isomorphisms. The bundled form of
this fact is Mathlib's `MulEquiv.monoidHomCongrLeft`; the statement here is the one to use when
the isomorphism is given as a homomorphism known to be bijective, and the precomposition map is
the unbundled `compHom'`.

Dually, for `f : N →* P` between commutative monoids, `MonoidHom.compHom f` is postcomposition with
`f`, as a homomorphism `(M →* N) →* M →* P`. It is bijective as soon as `f` is injective and its
range contains every `n`-th root of unity of `P`, provided every element of `M` satisfies
`a ^ n = 1`: a homomorphism out of `M` takes values in the `n`-th roots of unity, so `Hom(M, -)`
sees such an `f` as an isomorphism. This is the form in which an injection of coefficient groups
whose image is the `n`-torsion induces bijections on duals.

The same transport principle applies to biadditive pairings: bijective changes of both variables
and of the target preserve bijectivity of the curried homomorphism.

## Main results

* `MonoidHom.compHom'_bijective`, `AddMonoidHom.compHom'_bijective`: precomposition with a bijective
  homomorphism is bijective on homomorphisms into a commutative monoid.
* `MonoidHom.compHom_bijective_of_forall_pow_eq_one`,
  `AddMonoidHom.compHom_bijective_of_forall_nsmul_eq_zero`: postcomposition with an injective
  homomorphism onto the `n`-th roots of unity is bijective on homomorphisms out of a monoid killed
  by `n`.
* `MonoidHom.compHom_bijective`, `AddMonoidHom.compHom_bijective`: postcomposition with a bijective
  homomorphism is bijective on homomorphisms out of any unital magma.
* `AddMonoidHom.bijective_of_bijective_pairing`: bijectivity of a curried biadditive pairing is
  preserved by bijective changes of variables and target.
* `TauCeti.forall_eq_zero_and_exists_eq_of_bijective_of_addEquiv`: a pairing that reads, through
  additive equivalences, as a bijective curried homomorphism separates the points of its second
  argument, and every homomorphism out of its first argument is pairing with some point.
