# Non-negativity of a binary quadratic form and its discriminant

Mathlib's `discrim_le_zero` shows that a quadratic polynomial over a linearly ordered field which
is non-negative at every point of the field has non-positive discriminant. This file supplies two
facts about the homogeneous two-variable form `a * x ^ 2 + b * x * y + c * y ^ 2` that it does not
give: the reverse implication, and an integral version whose hypothesis is much weaker. It also
records two elementary facts about discriminants used for positive definite integral forms: a
negative discriminant together with `0 ≤ a` forces `0 < a`, and an integral discriminant is `0` or
`1` modulo `4`.

The integral version is the substantial one, and it is worth being precise about what makes it
substantial. Over a *field*, non-negativity along a single line `y = y₀ ≠ 0` already forces
`discrim a b c ≤ 0`: the restriction is a quadratic in `x`, so `discrim_le_zero` applies and the
resulting `y₀ ^ 2 * discrim a b c ≤ 0` may be divided by `y₀ ^ 2`. Over `ℤ` the same hypothesis
with `x` ranging over the *integers* is strictly weaker, and is genuinely not enough: the map
`x ↦ x ^ 2 - x` is non-negative at every integer, yet `discrim 1 (-1) 0 = 1 > 0`, which is
`forall_int_nonneg_and_discrim_pos` below. `Int.discrim_le_zero_of_nonneg_of_lt_abs` says that one
extra condition — that `|y₀|` exceed the leading coefficient — repairs this, with no further
quantification needed.

Together with the reverse implication this gives the upgrade that motivates the file: a form known
to be non-negative only on some sparse subset of `ℤ ⨯ ℤ` — the locus where a fixed prime divides
neither coordinate, which is all that the degree form on an elliptic curve is directly known to
satisfy — is non-negative everywhere. `Int.discrim_le_zero_of_nonneg_of_not_dvd_of_not_dvd` pins
the discriminant from that locus alone, and `nonneg_of_discrim_le_zero` then propagates the
conclusion to every `(x, y)`.

## Main results

* `nonneg_of_discrim_le_zero`: `0 < a` and `discrim a b c ≤ 0` give `0 ≤ a x² + b x y + c y²`.
* `Int.discrim_le_zero_of_nonneg_of_lt_abs`: for `a < |y|`, and with no sign condition on `a`,
  non-negativity of `a x² + b x y + c y²` in `x` alone forces `discrim a b c ≤ 0`.
* `Int.discrim_le_zero_of_nonneg_of_not_dvd_of_not_dvd`: the same conclusion from non-negativity
  on `{(x, y) : d ∤ x ∧ d ∤ y}`, for any non-unit `d`.
* `pos_of_nonneg_of_discrim_lt_zero`: a quadratic of negative discriminant with `0 ≤ a` has
  `0 < a`.
* `Int.discrim_emod_four`: `discrim a b c % 4 = b % 2`, so an integral discriminant is `0` or `1`
  modulo `4`.

The two `Int.discrim_le_zero_…` results are proved from a common lemma in which `x` runs over an
arithmetic progression rather than all of `ℤ`. Only one `x` is ever used — the member of the
progression nearest the minimum of the restricted form — so thinning the line to gap `m` costs
exactly a factor `m` in the height hypothesis, which the choice of `y` absorbs; `m = 1` is the full
line.

The weaker hypothesis constraining only `y` is not stated separately: it is strictly stronger
than the one above, so a caller holding it applies the same theorem through
`fun x y _ hy => h x y hy`.

## Provenance

Ported from the AINTLIB `HasseWeil` project (Apache-2.0), revision `513e83879e2f`, file
`HasseWeil/WeilPairing/Discriminant.lean`, declarations `exists_int_balanced`,
`qf_nonneg_of_nonneg_on_coprime` and `qf_nonneg_of_nonneg_on_coprime_both`. The statements here
are strictly stronger: the form is arbitrary rather than `q r² − t r s + s²`, no primality is
assumed, and a single `y` replaces an infinite family of prime powers.

The source proves its two locus results independently, the `d ∤ y` one by an infinite family of
prime powers together with a balanced-remainder lemma. Neither is reproduced. The `d ∤ y`
statement is not carried at all: it follows from the `d ∤ x ∧ d ∤ y` one in a line, its hypothesis
being the stronger of the two. The balanced remainder it needed is Mathlib's `round`.

/-- A binary quadratic form with positive leading coefficient and non-positive discriminant is
non-negative. This is the implication opposite to Mathlib's `discrim_le_zero`, stated for the
homogeneous two-variable form and over a linearly ordered commutative ring rather than a field.
The hypothesis `0 < a` cannot be dropped: `discrim 0 0 (-1) = 0`, while `- y ^ 2` is negative. -/
