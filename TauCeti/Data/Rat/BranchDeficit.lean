# The deficit of branch data

**Branch data** is a genus `γ` together with a multiset of ramification indices `e₁, …, e_r`, each
at least two, and its **deficit** is

`2γ - 2 + ∑ᵢ (1 - 1/eᵢ)`.

For a quotient of a function field of genus `g` by a finite tame group of automorphisms `G`,
Riemann--Hurwitz makes the deficit of the branch data of `F / F^G` equal to `(2g - 2)/|G|`, so a
lower bound on a positive deficit is an upper bound on `|G|`.

The sharp bound is `1/42`, attained by the genus-zero data `(2, 3, 7)`. It is reached only there:
each branch point contributes between `1/2` and `1`, so genus at least two leaves at least `2` and
genus one at least `1/2`, while genus zero needs more than two branch points, and with four or more
of them a positive deficit is at least `1/6`. Only genus-zero data with exactly three branch points
comes closer, and there the deficit `1 - 1/a - 1/b - 1/c` is the hyperbolic triple bound of
`TauCeti/Data/Rat/HurwitzTriangle.lean`, whose values do drop below `1/6` — `(2, 3, 8)` gives
`1/24` — down to `1/42`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.one_div_forty_two_le_hyperbolic_deficit`: a positive deficit is at least `1/42`.
* `TauCeti.hyperbolic_deficit_two_three_seven`: the genus-zero data `(2, 3, 7)` attains it.
* `TauCeti.half_le_one_sub_one_div` and `Nat.one_sub_one_div_le_one`: the contribution of one
  branch point, with the sums `TauCeti.card_div_two_le_sum_one_sub_one_div`,
  `Multiset.sum_one_sub_one_div_le_card` and `TauCeti.sum_one_sub_one_div_eq_card_div_two`.

/-- **The sharp numerical bound for hyperbolic branch data**: for a genus `γ` and ramification
indices all at least two, a positive deficit `2γ - 2 + ∑ᵢ (1 - 1/eᵢ)` is at least `1/42`.

For a function field of genus `g` and a finite tame group of automorphisms `G`, Riemann--Hurwitz
makes the deficit of the branch data of `F / F^G` equal to `(2g - 2)/|G|`, so this is the numerical
half of the bound `|G| ≤ 84 (g - 1)`. Outside genus-zero data with exactly three branch points a
positive deficit is at least `1/6`; the smaller values, down to `1/42` at `(2, 3, 7)`, are the
hyperbolic triples. -/
