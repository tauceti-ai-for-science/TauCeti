# The homology of spheres

For a point `p` of the unit sphere `S` of a real normed space, the complements of `p` and of `-p`
form an open cover of `S` by two contractible sets whose intersection is `S ∖ {p, -p}`. The
reduced Mayer–Vietoris connecting morphism of this cover is therefore an isomorphism
`Hₖ₊₁(S) ≅ H_redₖ(S ∖ {p, -p})` in every degree. In a real inner product space, `S ∖ {p, -p}` is
homotopy equivalent to the unit sphere of the orthogonal complement `(ℝ ∙ p)ᗮ`, and composing
gives the isomorphism `H_redₖ₊₁(S) ≅ H_redₖ(S ∩ (ℝ ∙ p)ᗮ)`, lowering both the sphere's dimension
and the degree.

Iterating this suspension isomorphism down to the zero-sphere, whose reduced homology is one copy
of the coefficient object in degree zero and vanishes above, computes the reduced homology of the
unit sphere of an `(n + 1)`-dimensional real inner product space: it is one copy of the
coefficient object in degree `n` and vanishes in every other degree.

The identification with the coefficient object, that is, the generator of `H_redₙ(Sⁿ)`, is
determined by an orthonormal basis `b` indexed by `Fin (n + 1)`: the suspension isomorphisms are
taken at the last basis vector, then at the last remaining one on the equator, and so on, down to
the zero-sphere `{b 0, -b 0}` with generator `[-b 0] - [b 0]`.  The suspension isomorphism is
natural under linear isometries carrying one pole to the other, so a linear isometry carrying the
basis `b` to a basis `c` carries the generator determined by `b` to the generator determined by
`c`.

The generator depends on `b` only through its orientation.  A linear isometry negating `b 0` and
fixing the other basis vectors fixes the last one, so it commutes with the suspension isomorphisms
and acts by `-1`, as it swaps the two points of the zero-sphere `{b 0, -b 0}`.  Every reflection
has this form for a suitable basis, so it acts by `-1` on `H_redₙ(S)`; by the Cartan–Dieudonné
theorem every linear isometry is a product of reflections, so it acts by the sign of its
determinant.  Applied to the isometry carrying one orthonormal basis to another, this shows that
bases of the same orientation determine the same generator and bases of opposite orientations
determine opposite generators.  In particular the antipodal map acts by `(-1) ^ (n + 1)`.

Mathlib's `TopCat.sphere n` is the universe lift of the unit sphere of
`EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin (n + 1))`; through `TauCeti.diskBoundaryHomeomorph` it is homeomorphic to
the unit sphere of a Euclidean space of the same dimension in the lifted universe, so the same
computation applies to it, and the standard basis of that space gives its standard generator.

For the unit circle `S` of a two-dimensional real inner product space, the explicit form of the
Mayer–Vietoris sequence is recorded directly: the cover is by the two open arcs `S ∖ {p}` and
`S ∖ {-p}`, whose intersection `S ∖ {p, -p}` consists of two open arcs, the path components of any
of its points `x` and of `-x`.  The connecting morphism `H₁(S) ⟶ H₀(S ∖ {p, -p})` identifies
`H₁(S)` with one copy of the coefficient object and sends the resulting generator to `[-x] - [x]`.

Coefficients are an object `R` of an abelian category with coproducts.

## Main definitions and results

* `TauCeti.isZero_reducedSingularHomologyFunctor_sphere_compl_singleton`: the unit sphere minus a
  point is acyclic.
* `TauCeti.isIso_reducedMayerVietorisδ_sphere`: the reduced Mayer–Vietoris connecting morphism
  `Hₖ₊₁(S) ⟶ H_redₖ(S ∖ {p, -p})` of the cover of `S` by the complements of `p` and `-p` is an
  isomorphism.
* `TauCeti.reducedSingularHomologySphereSuccIso`: the isomorphism
  `H_redₖ₊₁(S) ≅ H_redₖ(S ∩ (ℝ ∙ p)ᗮ)`, given by that connecting morphism followed by the homotopy
  equivalence of `S ∖ {p, -p}` with the equator, and
  `TauCeti.reducedSingularHomologySphereSuccIso_hom_naturality`: its naturality under linear
  isometries.
* `TauCeti.reducedSingularHomologySphereIsoOfFinrankEq`: the unit spheres of two
  finite-dimensional real normed spaces of the same dimension have isomorphic reduced homology,
  which transports the computations below from inner product spaces to normed spaces.
* `TauCeti.reducedSingularHomologySphereZeroIso`: `H_red₀(S) ≅ R` for the zero-sphere, with
  generator `[-p] - [p]`.
* `TauCeti.singularHomologySphereOneIso` and
  `TauCeti.singularHomologySphereOneIso_inv_mayerVietorisδ`: `H₁(S) ≅ R` for the circle, whose
  generator the Mayer–Vietoris connecting morphism of the cover by `S ∖ {p}` and `S ∖ {-p}` sends
  to `[-x] - [x]` in the zeroth homology of `S ∖ {p, -p}`.
* `TauCeti.isZero_reducedSingularHomologyFunctor_sphere_of_ne`: for `finrank ℝ E = n + 1`, the
  reduced homology of the unit sphere of `E` vanishes in degrees `k ≠ n`.
* `TauCeti.reducedSingularHomologySphereIso`: the isomorphism `H_redₙ(S) ≅ R` determined by an
  orthonormal basis of `E` indexed by `Fin (n + 1)`, with the recursion
  `TauCeti.reducedSingularHomologySphereIso_succ` and the degree-zero generator
  `TauCeti.reducedSingularHomologySphereIso_inv_ι`.
* `TauCeti.reducedSingularHomologySphereIso_hom_naturality`: a linear isometry matching two
  orthonormal bases carries the generator determined by one to the generator determined by the
  other.
* `TauCeti.reducedSingularHomologyFunctor_map_reflection_unitSphereMap` and
  `TauCeti.reducedSingularHomologyFunctor_map_unitSphereMap`: a reflection acts on `H_redₙ(S)` by
  `-1`, and a linear isometry by the sign of its determinant.
* `TauCeti.reducedSingularHomologySphereIso_hom_eq_sign_det_smul`,
  `TauCeti.reducedSingularHomologySphereIso_eq_of_orientation_eq` and
  `TauCeti.reducedSingularHomologySphereIso_hom_eq_neg_of_orientation_ne`: the generator determined
  by an orthonormal basis depends only on its orientation, and reversing the orientation negates
  it.
* `TauCeti.reducedSingularHomologyFunctor_map_sphere_neg`: the antipodal map acts on `H_redₙ(S)`
  by `(-1) ^ (n + 1)`.
* `TauCeti.isZero_reducedSingularHomologyFunctor_topCatSphere_of_ne` and
  `TauCeti.reducedSingularHomologyTopCatSphereIso`: the same for Mathlib's `TopCat.sphere n`, with
  the standard generator determined by the standard basis.
* `ModuleCat.finrank_singularHomology_sphere`: with coefficients in a free module `M` of finite
  rank, `H_q(Sᵈ; M)` is free of rank `rank M` for `q = 0` and for `q = d` (of rank `2 rank M`
  when `d = q = 0`), and vanishes otherwise.

homology of `TopCat.sphere n` in degree `n` is one copy of the coefficient object, through the
homeomorphism `TauCeti.diskBoundaryHomeomorph` with the unit sphere of
`EuclideanSpace ℝ (ULift (Fin (n + 1)))` and the generator
`TauCeti.reducedSingularHomologySphereIso` determined by the standard basis of that space, in its
order.  The generator involves no choices: by `TauCeti.reducedSingularHomologySphereIso_succ` it
is obtained from the class `[-e₀] - [e₀]` of the zero-sphere by suspending successively at the
last standard basis vector. -/
