# The transfer identifies the homology of the base of a finite quotient covering with invariants

Let a finite group `G` act on a space `E` so that `p : E ⟶ B` is the quotient covering map of the
action, in the sense of Mathlib's `IsQuotientCoveringMap`. The transfer
`t : C(B; R) ⟶ C(E; R)` of the finite covering `p` sends a singular simplex to the sum of its
lifts. Each `g : G` permutes those lifts, so `t ≫ g_* = t`: the transfer is a cone
`hG.transferCone R` over the action of `G` on `C(E; R)`.

This file shows that, when multiplication by `|G|` is invertible on the coefficients `R`, the
transfer exhibits `Hₙ(B; R)` as the invariants `Hₙ(E; R)^G`:

* `IsQuotientCoveringMap.isLimitMapConeTransferCone`: every additive functor out of chain
  complexes, and in particular homology, sends `hG.transferCone R` to a limit cone.
* `IsQuotientCoveringMap.isLimitHomologyMapConeTransferCone`: `Hₙ(B; R)` is the limit
  `Hₙ(E; R)^G` of the action of `G` on `Hₙ(E; R)`, with leg the transfer.

The argument is the one for coinvariants
(`IsQuotientCoveringMap.isColimitMapCoconeSingularHomology`) read backwards: `t ≫ p_* = |G| • 𝟙`
and `p_* ≫ t = ∑_{g ∈ G} g_*`, so `|G|⁻¹ • p_*` retracts the transfer onto the invariants
(`CategoryTheory.Limits.SingleObj.isLimitOfTransfer`). Without the invertibility of `|G|` the
statement fails, already for the double cover of `ℝP²` by `S²` with coefficients `ℤ` in degree
zero, where the transfer is multiplication by `2` on `ℤ`.

/-- **The transfer is invariant under the action.** For the quotient covering map `p : E ⟶ B` of
an action of a finite group `G`, the transfer `C(B; R) ⟶ C(E; R)` commutes with the action of `G`
on `C(E; R)` by the chain maps `g_*`, so it is a natural transformation from the constant functor
at `C(B; R)` to that action. -/
