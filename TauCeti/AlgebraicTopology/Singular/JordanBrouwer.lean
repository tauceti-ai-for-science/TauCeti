# The complement of an embedded sphere and the Jordan–Brouwer separation theorem

Let `Y` be a Hausdorff space in which the complement of every point has vanishing reduced
homology, such as a sphere. If `h : Sᵈ⁻¹ → Y` is an embedding of the unit sphere of a
`d`-dimensional real normed space, then the reduced homology of `Y ∖ h(Sᵈ⁻¹)` is that of `Y`
shifted down by `d`: `H_redᵢ(Y ∖ h(Sᵈ⁻¹)) ≅ H_redᵢ₊d(Y)`. For `Y = Sⁿ` this is the second half of
Hatcher's Proposition 2B.1: the complement of an embedded `k`-sphere in `Sⁿ` has the reduced
homology of an `(n - k - 1)`-sphere.

The sphere of a `d`-dimensional real normed space is homeomorphic to that of a Euclidean space of
the same dimension (`TauCeti.sphereHomeomorphOfFinrankEq`), so it suffices to treat inner
product spaces. The proof is then by induction on `d`. The unit sphere `Sᵈ⁻¹` is empty when
`d = 0`. Otherwise it is the union of the two closed hemispheres around a unit vector `p`, which
meet in the equator, the unit sphere of `(ℝ ∙ p)ᗮ`. The hemispheres are discs
(`TauCeti.hemisphereHomeomorph`), so the complements of their images are acyclic
(`TauCeti.isZero_reducedSingularHomologyFunctor_compl_range_closedBall`). These two complements
are open, their intersection is `Y ∖ h(Sᵈ⁻¹)` and their union is the complement of the image of the
equator, so the Mayer–Vietoris sequence (`TopCat.reducedMayerVietorisIsoOfIsZero`) shifts degrees
by one while lowering the dimension of the sphere by one.

In the top case of a sphere `Sᵈ⁻¹` embedded in `Sᵈ`, the reduced homology of the complement in
degree zero is one copy of the coefficients. With field coefficients, this says that the
complement has exactly two path components: the **Jordan–Brouwer separation theorem**.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.reducedSingularHomologyComplRangeSphereIso`: in a Hausdorff space `Y` whose point
  complements are acyclic, `H_redᵢ(Y ∖ h(Sᵈ⁻¹)) ≅ H_redᵢ₊d(Y)` for every embedding `h` of the unit
  sphere of a `d`-dimensional real normed space.
* `TauCeti.isZero_reducedSingularHomologyFunctor_sphere_compl_range_sphere` and
  `TauCeti.reducedSingularHomologySphereComplRangeSphereIso`: for `Y = Sⁿ`, the reduced homology of
  the complement of an embedded `Sᵈ⁻¹` vanishes in degrees `i ≠ n - d` and is one copy of the
  coefficients in degree `n - d`.
* `TauCeti.natCard_zerothHomotopy_sphere_compl_range_eq_two`: **the Jordan–Brouwer separation
  theorem**: the complement of an embedded `Sⁿ⁻¹` in `Sⁿ` has exactly two path components.
