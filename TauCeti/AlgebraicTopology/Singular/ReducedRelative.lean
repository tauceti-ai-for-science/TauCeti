# Reduced connecting morphism for relative singular homology

For every topological pair `(X, A)`, the connecting morphism `Hₖ₊₁(X, A) ⟶ Hₖ(A)` of the long
exact sequence lands in the reduced homology of `A`. In degree zero, this follows because the
connecting morphism is killed by the map to `H₀(X)`, which commutes with augmentation.
The resulting morphism `TopPair.reducedSingularHomologyδ` is natural in maps of pairs and is an
isomorphism when the reduced homology of `X` vanishes in degrees `k` and `k + 1`.  Dually, the
quotient map `Hₖ₊₁(X) ⟶ Hₖ₊₁(X, A)` is an isomorphism when the reduced homology of `A` vanishes in
degrees `k` and `k + 1` (`TopPair.isIso_singularHomologyπ`).

Coefficients are an object of an abelian category with coproducts.

The construction follows Hatcher, *Algebraic Topology*, Section 2.1, on the reduced long exact
sequence of a pair.
