# Subcomplexes in the weak realization topology

An inclusion of abstract simplicial complexes realizes to a closed embedding, without a
finiteness or local-finiteness hypothesis. Thus a subcomplex has exactly the subspace topology
inside the larger polyhedron. This permits closed subcomplexes to be used as local models and
as the fixed parts of geometric deformations.

Closedness in the weak topology is tested on each closed simplex. On any one simplex, a
subcomplex meets it in finitely many faces. This finite-face argument proves that inclusion
sends every closed subset to a closed subset, even when the whole complex is infinite.

For a precomplex, its polyhedron is the subset of ambient realization points whose supports
are its faces. The closed-set and continuity criteria apply to this actual subset, so links
and deletions introduce no extra vertices. Continuity into an arbitrary topological space
is determined by restriction to the subcomplex's closed simplices.
