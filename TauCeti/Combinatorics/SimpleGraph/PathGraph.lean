# A finite tree of maximum degree two is a path graph

A finite connected graph in which every vertex has at most two neighbours is a path or a cycle, and
acyclicity leaves the path. This file proves that identification in the form a consumer wants: a
finite tree of maximum degree two is isomorphic to Mathlib's `SimpleGraph.pathGraph` on as many
vertices as it has, so its vertices can be numbered `0, …, n - 1` with two of them adjacent exactly
when their numbers are consecutive.

The proof takes a path `p` of greatest length in the graph, which Mathlib's
`SimpleGraph.exists_isPath_forall_isPath_length_le_length` supplies. Every neighbour of a vertex of
`p` again lies on `p`: at an interior vertex because the two neighbours along `p` already exhaust
the degree bound, and at an endpoint because a neighbour off `p` could be prepended, contradicting
maximality. The vertices of `p` therefore admit no boundary edge, so connectedness makes them all of
the vertices, and a count of edges finishes the argument: a tree has one edge fewer than it has
vertices, `p` already supplies that many distinct edges, and so every edge of the graph is an edge
of `p`. The subgraph spanned by `p` is therefore all of `G`, and Mathlib's
`SimpleGraph.Walk.IsPath.pathGraphIsoToSubgraph` identifies it with a path graph.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.IsTree.nonempty_iso_pathGraph_of_degree_le_two`: a finite tree of maximum degree two is
  isomorphic to the path graph on its vertices.
* `TauCeti.adj_iff_of_iso_pathGraph`: adjacency read through such a numbering is consecutiveness of
  the numbers.
* `TauCeti.pathGraphRevIso`: the reversal automorphism of a path graph, which reverses a numbering.

## References

The argument is the standard one; see R. Diestel, *Graph Theory*, 5th ed., Ch. 1.5, for trees and
their edge count.
