# The overlaid difference of two graphons

Given a coupling of two probability spaces, two graphons living on *different* carriers can be
compared: read `U` through the first coordinate, read `W` through the second, and subtract. The
result is the **overlaid difference kernel** `overlayDiff U W π`, a symmetric kernel on the coupled
space `(Ω₁ × Ω₂, π)`. The carrier-independent coupling relation `TauCeti.IsCoupling π μ₁ μ₂` and
its API live in `TauCeti.MeasureTheory.OptimalTransport.Coupling`. That relation is a `Prop`
rather than a class: a coupling of two given marginals is not canonical, and the cut distance
takes an infimum over all of them.

These two objects are what makes the cut distance of the dense graph limit theory cross-carrier.
`cutDist U W` is the infimum, over all couplings `π`, of the cut norm of `overlayDiff U W π`; the
cut norm acts on kernels, and `overlayDiff U W π` is exactly the kernel it is applied to. Neither
object needs a standard Borel or atomless hypothesis, which is why the resulting distance is
*defined* on arbitrary probability carriers. That its triangle inequality also holds there is a
separate result, proved by step-graphon approximation (Janson, Lemma 6.5) rather than by gluing
couplings, and is not built here.

**`overlayDiff` does not need the coupling hypothesis.** The measure argument of `SymmKernel` is a
phantom parameter, so the kernel `fun p q => U p.1 q.1 - W p.2 q.2` is well-formed over *any*
measure `π` on `Ω₁ × Ω₂`. The marginal conditions enter one level up, where the cut norm integrates
against `π`; keeping them off the constructor means the pointwise algebra below — and in particular
`overlayDiff_swap`, the swap symmetry the cut distance's `cutDist_comm` runs on — carries no
hypotheses at all.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.DenseGraphLimits.overlayDiff` — the overlaid difference kernel of two graphons on a
  coupling of their carriers.

## Main results

* `overlayDiff_apply`, `abs_overlayDiff_apply_le_one` — the eliminator and the `[-1, 1]` bound;
* `overlayDiff_swap` — swapping the two graphons negates the overlaid difference, up to the pullback
  along `Prod.swap`, for *any* two measures on the two products;
* `comap_overlayDiff_prodMk` — pulling back along a pair of maps gives the difference of the two
  kernel pullbacks;
* `comap_overlayDiff_diagonalCoupling` — on a common carrier the overlaid difference along the
  diagonal coupling pulls back along the diagonal to the plain difference `U - W`.

/-- The **overlaid difference kernel** of two graphons along a measure `π` on the product of their
carriers: `U` read through the first coordinate minus `W` read through the second.

This is the kernel whose cut norm the cut distance minimizes over couplings — not a neutral overlay
of the two graphons, but the difference that the counting lemma bounds a density gap by. It is a
literal difference of two `SymmKernel.comap`s, so the kernel algebra applies to it directly.

The measure `π` is unconstrained here: `SymmKernel` carries its measure as a phantom parameter, and
the marginal conditions are only needed once the cut norm integrates against `π`. -/

/-- Swapping the roles of the two graphons — and correspondingly the two coordinates of the
coupling — negates the overlaid difference.

This is the identity behind the symmetry of the cut distance: the cut norm is even and invariant
under the pullback along the measure-preserving `Prod.swap`, so the two infima agree. Both measures
are unconstrained — they are phantom parameters of the two kernel types — so a caller holding a
coupling `ρ` of `μ₂, μ₁` may use it directly, without rewriting `ρ` into the form `π.map Prod.swap`
inside its type. -/

/-- On a common carrier, the overlaid difference of `U` and `W` along the diagonal coupling pulls
back along the diagonal `x ↦ (x, x)` to their plain difference as kernels.

`diagonalCoupling μ` is the pushforward of `μ` along that same diagonal, and
by `MeasureTheory.Measure.isCoupling_diagonalCoupling` it is one of the couplings the cross-carrier
cut distance takes an infimum over. This identity computes the kernel it contributes; recognizing
the resulting value as the same-carrier cut norm `‖U - W‖□` additionally needs the invariance of
the cut norm under measure-preserving pullback, and is `cutNorm_overlayDiff_diagonalCoupling` in
`TauCeti.Combinatorics.DenseGraphLimits.CutMetric.Distance`. -/
