# The triangle inequality for graphon cut distance

This file proves the triangle inequality for the coupling-primary cut distance on arbitrary
probability carriers.  The central finite-middle case glues two couplings over a countable
intermediate carrier and pulls all three overlaid kernels back to the glued probability space,
where their difference telescopes.  Exact invariance of the cut norm under
measure-preserving pullback then returns the estimate to the original couplings.

For an arbitrary intermediate carrier, Frieze--Kannan weak regularity replaces the middle graphon
by a finite step graphon.  Its finite set of blocks is the countable middle carrier to which the
gluing argument applies, and stability of cut distance under cut-norm approximation removes the
replacement error.  This avoids imposing standard-Borel or atomlessness hypotheses on any of the
three carriers.

The triangle inequality is the last pseudometric law still missing, so this file also equips the
strict graphons on a fixed probability carrier with the cut-distance pseudometric.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.DenseGraphLimits.cutDist_triangle` proves the triangle inequality on arbitrary
  probability carriers.
* `TauCeti.DenseGraphLimits.cutDist_congr_left` and
  `TauCeti.DenseGraphLimits.cutDist_congr_right` say that graphons at cut distance zero have the
  same cut distance to every graphon.
* `TauCeti.DenseGraphLimits.cutDist_comap_right` states that reading the right-hand graphon along
  a measure-preserving map leaves the cut distance unchanged.
* `TauCeti.DenseGraphLimits.Graphon.instPseudoMetricSpace` is the cut-distance pseudometric on
  strict graphons over one carrier, and
  `TauCeti.DenseGraphLimits.Graphon.dist_eq_cutDist` identifies its distance with `cutDist`.

/-- Pulling the three overlaid differences to a joint law makes the outer difference telescope.

Here `gamma` has `pi12` as its `(Omega1, Omega2)` marginal and `pi23` as its
`(Omega2, Omega3)` marginal.  Its outer marginal is therefore a coupling of `mu1` and `mu3`, and
the cut norm along that coupling is at most the sum of the two input cut norms. -/
