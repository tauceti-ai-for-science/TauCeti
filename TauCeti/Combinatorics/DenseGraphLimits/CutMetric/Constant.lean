# The cut distance to a constant graphon

The cut distance is an infimum over couplings, and in general no single coupling attains it. Against
a **constant** graphon the infimum is trivial: the overlaid difference only reads the other graphon
through its own coordinate, so every coupling contributes the same value, and

`δ□(U, p) = ‖U - p‖□`,

the cut norm of `U - p` on the carrier of `U`, whatever the carrier of the constant graphon is
(`cutDist_const_right`). In particular two constant graphons are at cut distance `|p - q|`
(`cutDist_const_const`).

A graphon on a **point mass** `(Ω, δ_b)` is almost everywhere the constant graphon at its value at
`(b, b)` (`Graphon.ae_eq_const_of_dirac`), so the same formula computes the cut distance to it
(`cutDist_dirac_right`), and two point-mass graphons are at cut distance `|U a a - W b b|`
(`cutDist_dirac_dirac`).

These are the cases where the cut distance can be evaluated exactly on atomic carriers, which makes
them the reference values for checking any other description of the cut distance there.

## Main results

* `cutDist_const_right`, `cutDist_const_left` — the cut distance to a constant graphon on an
  arbitrary probability carrier is the cut norm of the difference with that constant;
* `cutDist_const_const` — two constant graphons are at cut distance `|p - q|`;
* `cutDist_dirac_right`, `cutDist_dirac_left`, `cutDist_dirac_dirac` — the corresponding values
  for graphons on point masses.
