# The cut distance of two graphons

The **cut distance** of two graphons is

`δ□(U, W) = inf { ‖overlayDiff U W π‖□ | π a coupling of the two carriers }`,

the infimum, over couplings of the two carriers, of the cut norm of the overlaid difference. This
file defines it and develops the part of its theory that does not need the triangle inequality.

**Coupling-primary, and cross-carrier by construction.** `U` and `W` live on *different*
probability spaces, and nothing here asks them to be standard Borel or atomless — a coupling
always exists (`isCoupling_prod`), so the infimum is over a nonempty set of nonnegative reals and
is a genuine infimum rather than a junk value. The competing definition, an infimum over
measure-preserving maps into a common carrier, is not more general: it agrees with this one over
standard Borel carriers, which is a separate later target.

**The triangle inequality is not proved here.** On arbitrary carriers it is Janson's Lemma 6.5,
whose proof reduces the gluing of two couplings to the finite case by step-graphon approximation,
and the roadmap makes that reduction a milestone of its own. Everything below — nonnegativity, the
`[0, 1]` range, symmetry, reflexivity, and the common-carrier upper bound — is independent of it.

**Symmetry is a swap of couplings, not a rearrangement.** `cutDist_comm` holds on arbitrary
carriers because `Prod.swap` turns a coupling of `μ₁, μ₂` into one of `μ₂, μ₁` and negates the
overlaid difference, and the cut norm is even and drops along a pushforward
(`cutNorm_le_cutNorm_comap`). No common carrier and no measurable-isomorphism hypothesis appears.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.DenseGraphLimits.cutDist` — the infimum of the overlaid cut norms over couplings of the
  two carriers.

## Main results

* `cutDist_le` and `le_cutDist` are the introduction and elimination rules for the infimum, and
  `exists_isCoupling_cutNorm_lt` produces a coupling beating any strict upper bound;
* `cutDist_nonneg` and `cutDist_le_one` are the range;
* `cutDist_comm` is symmetry;
* `cutNorm_overlayDiff_map_prodMk` computes the overlaid cut norm of a coupling induced by two
  measure-preserving maps, and `cutDist_le_cutNorm_sub_of_measurePreserving` bounds the cut
  distance by that value; `cutDist_le_cutNorm_sub` is its identity case, and `cutDist_self`
  follows;
* `cutDist_le_cutDist_comap_right` compares the cut distance with its value against a
  measure-preserving pullback of the right-hand graphon;
* `cutNorm_overlayDiff_diagonalCoupling` computes the value the diagonal coupling contributes to
  that infimum: it is exactly the same-carrier cut norm of the difference.

## Implementation

The private implementation set `couplingCutNorms` is named rather than inlined because both `csInf`
rules need it: `cutDist_le` needs the set to be bounded below and `le_cutDist` needs it to be
nonempty, and those two facts are stated about it once instead of being unfolded at each use. The
definition carries the `IsFiniteMeasure` evidence supplied by a coupling explicitly, in the `@`
form, because an existentially quantified witness cannot supply an instance by unification. Since
`IsFiniteMeasure` is a `Prop` class, that instance is interchangeable with any other by proof
irrelevance, and callers holding `[IsProbabilityMeasure π]` may use the lemmas below with the
ordinary `cutNorm π` on the nose.

/-- **A common carrier bounds the cut distance.** If `f` and `g` are measure preserving from a
common finite-measure space onto the two carriers, then the cut distance is at most the ordinary cut
norm of the difference of the two pullbacks.

This is the inequality that makes the measure-preserving-map picture an upper bound for the
coupling-primary one: the graph of `(f, g)` pushes `μ` forward to a coupling
(`isCoupling_map_prodMk_of_measurePreserving`), and the overlaid difference along it pulls back to
the plain difference of the pullback kernels. That the infimum over such pairs is *equal* to the
cut distance is a separate, later target, and needs standard Borel carriers. -/
