# Homomorphism densities in a finite graph

Two densities of a finite pattern graph `F` in a finite host graph `G`:

* `homDensityFin F G = |Hom(F, G)| / |V(G)| ^ |V(F)|` — all homomorphisms;
* `injHomDensity F G = |Inj(F, G)| / (|V(G)|)_{|V(F)|}` — the *injective* ones, normalized by the
  **falling factorial**.

These are the finite-graph front of the sampling theory. Nothing here is about graphons, and nothing
here samples: these are the estimators the later sampling laws are estimators *of*.

## The falling factorial, not the binomial coefficient

`injHomDensity` divides by `(Fintype.card W).descFactorial (Fintype.card V)`, the number of
*ordered* injections of a `|V(F)|`-element set into `V(G)`. Its numerator counts ordered injective
homomorphisms, so the two agree as conventions. Dividing instead by `Nat.choose` would count
unordered images against ordered maps and bias the sampling estimator by `|V(F)|!` — the later
unbiasedness identity would read `k! · t(F, W)` rather than `t(F, W)`. The convention is fixed here
so that no downstream statement has to carry the correction.

## One counting convention, not two

`injHomDensity_eq_labelledCopyCount_div` rewrites the numerator of `injHomDensity` as Mathlib's
`SimpleGraph.labelledCopyCount`, through the counting bridge
`SimpleGraph.card_injective_hom_eq_labelledCopyCount`. Without it, `injHomDensity` would silently
establish a second counting convention alongside Mathlib's. Note that Mathlib puts the **host**
graph first, so the copy count of `F` inside `G` is `G.labelledCopyCount F`.

This settles the *numerator*. Mathlib has no hom-density primitive, so nothing here pins the
`descFactorial` denominator; that convention is chosen here and is pinned later by the unbiasedness
anchor `integral_injHomDensity_sampleGraph`.

## Counting with `Nat.card`

Both densities count with `Nat.card`, which is total: it returns `0` on an infinite type and needs
no `Fintype` instance or decidability on the hom type, on `G`, or on `G.Adj`. The counted types are
finite here, so no generality is lost — but the definitions can be stated and rewritten without
carrying decidability hypotheses that the analytic statements downstream would then inherit.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.DenseGraphLimits.homDensityFin` — the homomorphism density `t(F, G)`.
* `TauCeti.DenseGraphLimits.injHomDensity` — the injective homomorphism density `t₀(F, G)`.
Both density bodies stay unexposed; `homDensityFin_def` and `injHomDensity_def` are the unfolding
lemmas downstream modules should use.

## Main results

* `injHomDensity_eq_labelledCopyCount_div` — the injective density in terms of Mathlib's counting
  primitive;
* `homDensityFin_nonneg`, `homDensityFin_le_one`, `injHomDensity_nonneg`, `injHomDensity_le_one` —
  both densities lie in `[0, 1]`, unconditionally. The degenerate cases are included: when the host
  is empty and the pattern is not, numerator and denominator both vanish and `x / 0 = 0` gives `0`.

/-- The **homomorphism density** `t(F, G) = |Hom(F, G)| / |V(G)| ^ |V(F)|` of a finite pattern
graph `F` in a finite host graph `G`.

Counted with `Nat.card`, so no `Fintype` or decidability instance on the hom type or on `G` is
required. Use `homDensityFin_def` to unfold. -/

/-- The **injective homomorphism density** `t₀(F, G)`: ordered injective homomorphisms over the
falling factorial `(|V(G)|)_{|V(F)|}`.

The denominator counts *ordered* injections `V ↪ W`, matching the ordered numerator. `Nat.choose`
would not: it counts unordered images, and would bias the sampling estimator by `|V(F)|!`. Use
`injHomDensity_def` to unfold. -/

`V(F) → V(G)`.

No hypothesis is needed. When the host is empty and the pattern is not, numerator and denominator
both vanish and `x / 0 = 0` gives `0`. -/

No hypothesis is needed; the degenerate cases behave as for `homDensityFin_le_one`. -/
