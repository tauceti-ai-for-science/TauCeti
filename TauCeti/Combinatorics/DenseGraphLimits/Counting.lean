# The counting lemma

The **counting lemma** bounds the gap between the homomorphism densities of a finite graph `F` in
two graphons on one carrier by the cut norm of their difference:

`|t(F, U) - t(F, W)| ≤ e(F) · ‖U - W‖□`.

It is what makes the cut norm the right notion of distance for dense graph limits: the graph
observables `t(F, ·)` are Lipschitz in it, uniformly in everything but the number of edges of `F`.

Two graphons on *different* carriers are compared through a coupling `π` of the two carriers, which
reads both as graphons on `(Ω₁ × Ω₂, π)`; their difference there is the overlaid difference
`overlayDiff U W π`. Since the coordinate projections out of a coupling are measure preserving,
`homDensity_comap` says the two densities are unchanged by that reading, so the same-carrier
statement transfers verbatim: `counting_lemma_coupling`. This is the cross-carrier engine of the
separation layer, and the form in which the counting lemma meets the coupling-primary `cutDist`.

Since that bound holds along *every* coupling, taking the infimum over couplings replaces the
overlaid cut norm by the cut distance itself:

`|t(F, U) - t(F, W)| ≤ e(F) · δ□(U, W)`,

the cut-distance form `abs_homDensity_sub_le_cutDist`. It needs no standard-Borel, atomlessness, or
common-carrier assumption, and it is what makes each `t(F, ·)` Lipschitz — hence continuous — for
the cut metric.

**The proof is a telescope over the edges.** Swap the edges of `F` from `W` to `U` one at a time.
Each swap changes the integrand at a single edge `e₀ = s(a, b)`, weighted by the product of edge
factors over the *other* edges of `F`; the gap it contributes is bounded by `‖U - W‖□`, and there
are `e(F)` swaps. The hybrid stage is indexed by a subset `D` of the edges — the edges already
swapped — so the induction runs over `D` with the ambient edge set `E` fixed. That is the shape the
argument needs: an induction on `E` alone would have to carry the already-fixed edge factor of the
edge being peeled off, which is exactly the weight the single-edge bound consumes.

**One swap is a rectangle test.** `F` is a *simple* graph, so no edge other than `e₀` joins `a` to
`b`: every other edge misses `a`, or misses `b`, or both. Refreshing the two coordinates `a` and `b`
(`TauCeti.integral_pi_eq_integral_integral_update`) therefore leaves an inner double
integral whose weights *factor* — one `[0, 1]`-valued function of the new `a`-coordinate, one of the
new `b`-coordinate — and `abs_testIntegral_le_cutNorm` bounds such a pairing by the cut norm, with
no loss of constant. The outer integral is over a probability measure, so the bound survives it.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.DenseGraphLimits.counting_lemma` — the forward counting lemma
  `|t(F, U) - t(F, W)| ≤ e(F) · ‖U - W‖□`;
* `TauCeti.DenseGraphLimits.counting_lemma_top_fin_two` and
  `TauCeti.DenseGraphLimits.counting_lemma_top_fin_three` — the one-edge and triangle
  specializations, with constants `1` and `3`;
* `TauCeti.DenseGraphLimits.counting_lemma_coupling` — its cross-carrier coupling form, bounding the
  density gap of two graphons on different carriers by the cut norm of the overlaid difference along
  any coupling of the carriers;
* `TauCeti.DenseGraphLimits.abs_homDensity_sub_le_cutDist` — its cut-distance form
  `|t(F,U) − t(F,W)| ≤ e(F) · δ□(U, W)`, obtained by taking the infimum over couplings.

`s(a, b)`, weighted by edge factors over any finite family of *other* edges, integrates to at most
the cut norm of the difference.

Every other edge misses `a` or misses `b` — it cannot contain both, since it would then *be*
`s(a, b)` — so, once the coordinates `a` and `b` are refreshed, the weight splits into a function of
the new `a`-coordinate times a function of the new `b`-coordinate. -/

homomorphism densities of `F` in two graphons living on *different* probability spaces differ by at
most `e(F)` times the cut norm of their overlaid difference along `π`.

This is the cross-carrier engine: taking the infimum over couplings turns it into a bound by the
cut distance, and hence into the forward direction of the separation theorem. No standard Borel or
atomless hypothesis is needed, on either carrier.

The proof is the same-carrier `counting_lemma` on the coupled space `(Ω₁ × Ω₂, π)`. Reading `U` and
`W` there — as the pullbacks along the two coordinate projections, whose difference *is*
`overlayDiff U W π` — changes neither density, because the projections out of a coupling are
measure preserving (`homDensity_comap`).

The `IsFiniteMeasure` instance the cut norm needs is supplied explicitly from the coupling, matching
`TauCeti.DenseGraphLimits.cutDist_le`; being a `Prop` class it is interchangeable with any other. -/
