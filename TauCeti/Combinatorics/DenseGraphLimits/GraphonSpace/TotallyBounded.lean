# Graphon space is totally bounded

On the canonical carrier `(I, volume)` the space of graphons is **totally bounded**: for every `ε`
there are finitely many graphons within `ε` in cut distance of every graphon. The graphon space
over an arbitrary probability carrier embeds isometrically in the unit-interval one
(`isometry_toGraphonSpaceI`), so it is totally bounded as well.

The net is finite because a Frieze--Kannan approximation is a finite weighted graph on a vertex set
whose size depends only on `ε`, and both of its weightings can be pushed onto a grid at a controlled
cost: the block values by rounding down (`exists_gridValue_cutDist_le`) and the vertex weights by
rounding all but one of them down and letting the remaining vertex absorb the slack
(`exists_gridWeightMeasure_cutDist_le`).  Finitely many grid weightings of a fixed finite vertex set
remain, each read onto `(I, volume)` by `unitIntervalModel`, along a measure-preserving map out of
the unit interval (Janson, Theorem A.9).

Total boundedness is one of the two halves of the Lovász--Szegedy compactness theorem, the other
being completeness.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.DenseGraphLimits.totallyBounded_graphonSpaceI` -- `GraphonSpaceI` is totally bounded.
* `TauCeti.DenseGraphLimits.totallyBounded_graphonSpace` -- the graphon space over an arbitrary
  probability carrier is totally bounded.
