# Adversarial checks of strict graphon representatives

The passage from a measurable function to an almost-everywhere class must discard null-set
values, but must not discard values on atoms. These examples exercise both requirements.

On the unit interval, corrupt a graphon's zero row and zero column with the asymmetric values
`4` and `-6`. The resulting measurable function represents the same class, although it is neither
symmetric nor range-bounded everywhere. Averaging and clamping repairs it: the origin becomes
`1`, and the rest of the zero row and column become `0`. The repair preserves the class, every
homomorphism density, and the graphon-space point. In particular, a repaired constant graphon
need not be the same strict graphon. The representative bridge recovers the corrupted class and
its graphon-space point. On the uniform two-point atomic carrier, its returned representative
recovers the finite adjacency graphon pointwise; all four adjacency entries are also checked.

On a uniform two-point space, an asymmetric function cannot be represented by a graphon;
neither can the constant function `2` on a point mass. These checks distinguish almost-everywhere
constraints from constraints that could accidentally ignore positive-mass exceptional sets.

The examples use the strict-representative construction `Graphon.clampSymm` and the bridges
`exists_graphon_repr` and `exists_graphon_repr_iff`. The corrupted and repaired representatives on
the unit interval live in the namespace `NullLineExample`, so the round trip can be cited by name;
the exported theorem `Graphon.toAEEqFun_not_injective_unitInterval` records why strict equality
cannot be recovered.

## Main results

* `NullLineExample.exists_graphon_toAEEqFun_eq_mk_corrupted` — the corrupted class is represented
  by a strict graphon with the same graphon-space point;
* `NullLineExample.toAEEqFun_repaired`, `NullLineExample.graphonSpace_mk_repaired` — repairing
  preserves the class and the graphon-space point;
* `Graphon.toAEEqFun_not_injective_unitInterval` — the class map is not injective.
