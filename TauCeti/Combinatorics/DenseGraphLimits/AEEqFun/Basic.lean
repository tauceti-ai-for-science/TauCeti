# The almost-everywhere view of a graphon

A graphon is carried as a *strict* function `W : Ω → Ω → ℝ`, symmetric and `[0, 1]`-valued at every
point.  This file is the single place where the almost-everywhere picture enters: it sends a
graphon to its class `Graphon.toAEEqFun W : (Ω × Ω) →ₘ[μ ⊗ μ] ℝ` in Mathlib's `AEEqFun`, proves
that the three observables — homomorphism densities, the cut norm, and the cut distance — do not
see the difference between two representatives of one class, and exhibits the reverse passage: an
a.e. `[0, 1]`-valued, a.e. symmetric class is the class of a strict graphon.

**The strict and almost-everywhere views.** Carrying the strict function is
what makes `U - W` a literal kernel and `∀ x y, W x y ∈ Set.Icc 0 1` a stateable hypothesis, so the
cut norm and the counting lemma never carry a null-set side condition.  The price is that
representatives are not unique, and analytic arguments that produce a function only up to a null
set — conditional expectations and martingale limits — are naturally `AEEqFun`-native.  The
theorems below pay that price once: `homDensity_congr_ae`, `cutNorm_congr_ae` and
`cutDist_eq_zero_of_aeEq` say the strict representative may be chosen freely, and
`exists_graphon_repr` says such a choice always exists.

**The round trip is lossy in exactly one direction.** `Graphon.toAEEqFun` forgets the values of `W`
on a null set, so it is not injective; `exists_graphon_repr` inverts it only up to that forgetting.
What is *not* lost is the pair of pointwise constraints: the class of a graphon is a.e. `[0, 1]`
-valued and a.e. symmetric (`Graphon.toAEEqFun_mem_Icc_ae`, `Graphon.toAEEqFun_symm_ae`), and those
two conditions are exactly what a class needs in order to come from a graphon
(`exists_graphon_repr_iff`).  Symmetrising and clamping a measurable representative is what
converts "a.e." back into "everywhere".

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.DenseGraphLimits.Graphon.toAEEqFun` — the a.e. class of a graphon on `μ ⊗ μ`.

## Main results

* `Graphon.toAEEqFun_eq_iff` — two graphons have the same class exactly when they agree a.e.;
* `Graphon.ae_eq_const_of_dirac` — a graphon on a point mass agrees a.e. with its value there;
* `Graphon.toAEEqFun_mem_Icc_ae`, `Graphon.toAEEqFun_symm_ae` — the class of a graphon is a.e.
  `[0, 1]`-valued and a.e. symmetric;
* `Graphon.toAEEqFun_comap` — the class of a measure-preserving pullback is the composition of the
  class with the pullback, Mathlib's `AEEqFun.compMeasurePreserving`;
* `cutNorm_congr_ae` and `SymmKernel.rectIntegral_congr_ae` — the cut norm, and already each
  rectangle integral, factor through the a.e. class of a kernel;
* `homDensity_congr_ae` — homomorphism densities factor through the a.e. class of a graphon;
* `cutNorm_overlayDiff_congr_ae_left`, `cutDist_congr_ae_left` and `cutDist_congr_ae_right` — the
  cut distance itself, not merely its vanishing, factors through the a.e. classes of its two
  arguments, on arbitrary carriers;
* `cutDist_eq_zero_of_aeEq` — a.e. equal graphons are at cut distance zero;
* `exists_graphon_repr` and `exists_graphon_repr_iff` — an a.e. `[0, 1]`-valued, a.e. symmetric
  class is the class of a strict graphon, and only such a class is.

## Implementation

The rectangle integrals of two a.e. equal kernels agree because a.e. equality passes to the
restriction of `μ ⊗ μ` to a rectangle, and the cut norm is a supremum of their absolute values.
For the cut distance the a.e. hypothesis lives on `μ₁ ⊗ μ₁` while the overlaid difference lives on
`π ⊗ π` for a coupling `π`; the first-coordinate projection relates them, and is measure preserving
exactly because `π` has left marginal `μ₁`.  Every coupling therefore contributes the same value to
the two infima, which gives the invariance of `δ□` with no triangle inequality; vanishing on a.e.
equal graphons is then the case `U' = W` of that invariance together with `cutDist_self`.

For homomorphism densities the a.e. hypothesis lives on `μ ⊗ μ` while the integral is over
`Measure.pi`, so it has to be transported along the evaluation map `x ↦ (x a, x b)` at the two
endpoints of an edge.  That map is measure preserving precisely because the endpoints of an edge of
a `SimpleGraph` are distinct (`TauCeti.measurePreserving_eval_pair`); the finitely many edges are
then intersected with `Filter.eventually_all_finset`.

The strict representative built by `exists_graphon_repr` is
`fun x y => max 0 (min 1 ((f (x, y) + f (y, x)) / 2))`: the average symmetrises *everywhere*, not
just a.e., and the clamping puts the values in `[0, 1]` everywhere.  Both operations are the
identity a.e., which is what makes the result represent the class it started from — and both are
needed, since a class has no reason to have a representative with either property on the nose.
