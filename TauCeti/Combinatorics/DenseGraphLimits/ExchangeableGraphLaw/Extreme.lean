# Extreme exchangeable graph laws

The exchangeable probability measures on the graphs on `ℕ` form a convex set,
`exchangeableGraphProbabilityMeasures`. Its extreme points are the dissociated laws: an
exchangeable law on infinite graphs is an extreme point if and only if its finite law is
dissociated (`mem_extremePoints_iff_isDissociated`). This is the graph-side form of the
characterisation of joint dissociation as extremality among jointly exchangeable array laws, for
callers who work with graph laws; the two convex sets correspond under the graph-law/array-law
adapter (`arrayLaw_mem_iff`, `mem_extremePoints_iff_arrayLaw_mem_extremePoints`).

Two consequences. The infinite sampling law of a graphon is an extreme exchangeable graph measure
(`infiniteSampleLaw_mem_extremePoints`). And a dissociated exchangeable graph law does not mix:
a mixture of exchangeable graph laws equal to it has almost every component equal to it
(`InfiniteExchangeableGraphLaw.ae_eq_of_comp_eq`), the graph counterpart of
`JointlyDissociated.ae_eq_of_comp_eq`; it is the uniqueness input for representing an
exchangeable graph law as a mixture of dissociated ones. Both conclude equality of laws.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.DenseGraphLimits.exchangeableGraphProbabilityMeasures` — the convex set, with its
  membership and convexity lemmas and its identification with the carried array laws through the
  adapter (`arrayLaw_mem_iff`).
* `TauCeti.DenseGraphLimits.mem_extremePoints_iff_isDissociated` — **extremality is
  dissociation** for exchangeable graph laws.
* `TauCeti.DenseGraphLimits.infiniteSampleLaw_mem_extremePoints` — the infinite sampling law of
  a graphon is extreme.
* `TauCeti.DenseGraphLimits.InfiniteExchangeableGraphLaw.ae_eq_of_comp_eq` — a dissociated
  exchangeable graph law does not mix.
