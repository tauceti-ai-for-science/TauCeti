# Indexed quiver paths and partial concatenation

`TauCeti.Quiver.TotalPath Q` records a path of a quiver together with its source and target. Two
such paths can be concatenated when the target of the second is the source of the first. The
partial operation `TauCeti.Quiver.TotalPath.mul?` records this condition with an `Option` result,
using the later-factor-first order: `x.mul? y` traces `y` and then `x`.

Concatenation adds path lengths and keeps the source of the factor written second — the one traced
first — so it is the trivial path at a vertex exactly when both its factors are. It is associative
as a partial operation, and trivial paths are left and right units at the appropriate endpoints.
These operations supply the path index and multiplication of the path algebra, independently of any
coefficient semiring.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.Quiver.TotalPath`: the total space `Σ a b, Quiver.Path a b` of paths.
* `TauCeti.Quiver.TotalPath.mul?`: concatenation when the paths meet, and `none` otherwise.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.Quiver.TotalPath.eq_nil_iff`: a path is trivial at a vertex exactly when it starts
  there and has length zero.
* `TauCeti.Quiver.TotalPath.mul?_eq_none_iff`: concatenation is undefined exactly when the
  endpoints do not meet.
* `TauCeti.Quiver.TotalPath.length_eq_add_of_mul?_eq_some` and
  `TauCeti.Quiver.TotalPath.fst_of_mul?_eq_some`: concatenation adds lengths and keeps the source
  of the factor written second, which is traced first.
* `TauCeti.Quiver.TotalPath.eq_nil_iff_of_mul?_eq_some`: a concatenation is the trivial path at a
  vertex exactly when both its factors are.
* `TauCeti.Quiver.TotalPath.mul?_nil_left`, `TauCeti.Quiver.TotalPath.mul?_nil_right`, and
  `TauCeti.Quiver.TotalPath.mul?_assoc`: trivial-path units and associativity.
* `TauCeti.Quiver.TotalPath.mk_cons_eq_mk_cons_iff`: a path into a vertex is determined by its
  last arrow and the path before it.
