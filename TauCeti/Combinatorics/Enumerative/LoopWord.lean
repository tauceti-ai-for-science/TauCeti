# Loops at a base point and their excursions

A finite word that starts at a letter `a₀` and returns to it splits at its visits to `a₀` into
**excursions**: the (possibly empty) stretches of letters strictly between consecutive visits.
Conversely a list `bs : List (List α)` of excursions spells out a word

```text
a₀, bs[0], a₀, bs[1], a₀, …, bs[k-1], a₀
```

which this file calls `TauCeti.loopPath a₀ bs`.

The theorem of this file is that the transition counts of a loop are the sum of the transition
counts of its individual excursion loops (`TauCeti.transitionCount_loopPathAt`), so they do not
see the order in which the excursions are traversed
(`TauCeti.transitionCount_loopPathAt_eq_of_perm`). Together with the first-letter equality
`TauCeti.loopPathAt_zero` this is exactly the input of Diaconis and Freedman's Markov
exchangeability, where the first letter and the transition counts of a finite path are its
sufficient statistic: see `TauCeti/Probability/Exchangeability/Excursion.lean`.

The mechanism is a bookkeeping identity for the list `List.consecutivePairs l` of consecutive
pairs of a word. Concatenating two words at a shared letter `y` splits that list as the pairs of
the first word closed off with `y`, followed by the pairs of the second word
(`TauCeti.consecutivePairs_append_cons`); every excursion of a loop is closed off with `a₀`, so
iterating the split writes the pairs of `loopPath a₀ bs` as a `List.flatMap` over `bs`, which a
permutation of `bs` rearranges.

Words are lists here, while `TauCeti.transitionCount` counts transitions of a
`Fin (n + 1)`-indexed word; the bridge is `TauCeti.transitionCount_getD`, which reads a list of
length `n + 1` as such a word through `List.getD`. Both of those list lemmas live in
`TauCeti/Combinatorics/Enumerative/TransitionCount.lean`.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.loopPath`: the word spelled out by a base letter and a list of excursions.
* `TauCeti.loopSteps`: its number of transitions.
* `TauCeti.loopPathAt`: `loopPath` read as a function on `ℕ`, padded with the base letter.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.transitionCount_loopPathAt`: the transition counts of a loop are the sum of those of
  its excursion loops.
* `TauCeti.transitionCount_loopPathAt_eq_of_perm`: reordering the excursions leaves them unchanged.
* `TauCeti.exists_loopPath`: every word that starts and ends at `a₀` is a loop path, with
  excursions that avoid `a₀`.
* `TauCeti.loopPath_injOn`: those excursions are unique.
* `TauCeti.loopPathAt_cons_add`: past its first excursion a loop is the loop of the remaining ones.
* `TauCeti.loopPathAt_append_of_le`: over the span of its first excursions a loop is their loop.
* `TauCeti.infinite_setOf_loopPathAt_eq`: read as a function on `ℕ`, a loop returns to its base
  letter infinitely often.
* `TauCeti.map_range_loopPathAt`: reading that function over the loop's span spells the loop word
  out again.
