# Weight enumerators of concatenated codes

Concatenating words on disjoint coordinate types adds their Hamming weights. For any two finite
sets of words, the homogeneous and one-variable weight enumerators of their concatenation are
the products of the enumerators of the two sets, and its weight distribution is their convolution.
No additive or scalar closure, or finiteness of the alphabet, is needed. Thus these formulas apply
to additive codes as well as linear codes: the direct-sum formulas for finite additive codes over
an arbitrary group alphabet and for finite linear codes are both specializations.

The conventions follow Huffman and Pless, *Fundamentals of Error-Correcting Codes*, §1.6 and §7.2,
and MacWilliams and Sloane, *The Theory of Error-Correcting Codes*, Chapter 5, §2.
