# The knot group

The **knot group** of a knot `K : S¹ → M` is the fundamental group of its complement
`M \ K(S¹)` (`TauCeti.SmoothCircleEmbedding.KnotGroup`). It is the classical invariant through
which the Alexander module of a knot in `S³` is read: the commutator subgroup `π'` of the knot group
is the kernel of the abelianization `π → H₁(S³ \ K) ≅ ℤ`, so it is the fundamental group of the
infinite cyclic cover `X∞` of the complement, and the Alexander module `H₁(X∞)` is `π' / π''`.

A knot **has perfect commutator subgroup**
(`TauCeti.SmoothCircleEmbedding.HasPerfectCommutatorSubgroup`) when `π'' = π'` at every basepoint
of the complement, that is, when the Alexander module vanishes. For a knot in `S³`, or more
generally in a homology `3`-sphere, the Alexander module is presented by the square matrix
`tV - Vᵀ` of a Seifert matrix `V`, so it vanishes exactly when its order ideal is the unit ideal:
the condition is equivalent to the Alexander polynomial being `1` (Crowell; see Freedman–Quinn,
Theorem 11.7B). This is the hypothesis of Freedman's theorem that such knots are topologically
slice.

The knot group is invariant under ambient diffeomorphisms
(`TauCeti.SmoothCircleEmbedding.knotGroupTransDiffeomorphMulEquiv`), and the condition depends only
on the image of the knot, so it is unchanged by reparametrization. For a great circle of the
three-sphere the complement deformation retracts onto the complementary great circle
(`TauCeti.sphereDiffHomotopyEquiv`), so the knot group is infinite cyclic
(`TauCeti.SmoothCircleEmbedding.knotGroupGreatCircleMulEquiv`). In particular the unknot has abelian
knot group, hence trivial commutator subgroup, and it has perfect commutator subgroup.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.SmoothCircleEmbedding.KnotGroup`: the fundamental group of the complement of a knot.
* `TauCeti.SmoothCircleEmbedding.HasPerfectCommutatorSubgroup`: the commutator subgroup of the
  knot group is perfect at every basepoint.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.SmoothCircleEmbedding.knotGroupTransDiffeomorphMulEquiv`: an ambient diffeomorphism
  induces an isomorphism of knot groups.
* `TauCeti.SmoothCircleEmbedding.hasPerfectCommutatorSubgroup_transDiffeomorph_iff`,
  `TauCeti.SmoothCircleEmbedding.hasPerfectCommutatorSubgroup_rotate_iff` and
  `TauCeti.SmoothCircleEmbedding.hasPerfectCommutatorSubgroup_reverse_iff`: the condition is
  invariant under ambient diffeomorphisms and reparametrizations.
* `TauCeti.SmoothCircleEmbedding.hasPerfectCommutatorSubgroup_smoothAmbientIsotopic_iff`: the
  condition descends through the smooth geometric-presentation equivalence.
* `TauCeti.SmoothCircleEmbedding.knotGroupGreatCircleMulEquiv`: the knot group of a great circle in
  the three-sphere is infinite cyclic.
* `TauCeti.SmoothCircleEmbedding.hasPerfectCommutatorSubgroup_greatCircle` and
  `TauCeti.hasPerfectCommutatorSubgroup_unknot`: great circles, and in particular the unknot, have
  perfect commutator subgroup.
