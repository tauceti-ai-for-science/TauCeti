# Fully blocked empty rectangles in grid diagrams

This file packages the finite rectangle counts used by the fully blocked grid differential.
For grid states `x` and `y`, the already-defined `GridRectangleBetween x y` records an
oriented toroidal rectangle from `x` to `y`. Here we filter the generic empty-rectangle
enumeration to rectangles none of whose covered squares carries an `O` or `X` marking of a
grid diagram.

The final count is valued in `ZMod 2`, matching the first coefficient system used in the grid
homology roadmap.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.fullyBlockedRectangles`: empty rectangles avoiding all markings.
* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.fullyBlockedRectangleCount`: the corresponding count in `ZMod 2`.
* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.card_fullyBlockedRectangles_le_two`: at most two fully blocked rectangles
  contribute to each matrix coefficient.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.fullyBlockedRectangleCount_transpose`: the count is invariant under the
  diagonal reflection of a grid diagram and its two states.
* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.fullyBlockedRectangles_swapMarkings` and
  `TauCeti.GridDiagram.fullyBlockedRectangleCount_swapMarkings`: the rectangle set and its count
  are unchanged by swapping the `O` and `X` markings.

## References

This supplies a prerequisite for the Tau Ceti Heegaard Floer roadmap,
`CombinatorialHeegaardFloer/README.md` in TauCetiRoadmap, Lane G.3, "The complexes and
`∂² = 0`", where the fully blocked grid complex over `𝔽₂` counts rectangles avoiding all
markings. The objects and terminology follow Ozsváth--Stipsicz--Szabó, *Grid Homology for Knots
and Links*, Chapter 3; the marking-avoidance condition defining the fully blocked complex is in
Chapter 4, Section 4.4.

/-- The finite set of fully blocked empty rectangles from `x` to `y` in a grid diagram.

"Fully blocked" means that the rectangle is empty for the source grid state and none of the
squares it covers carries an `O` or `X` marking. This is the rectangle set whose parity gives
the coefficient of `y` in the fully blocked grid differential applied to `x`. -/
