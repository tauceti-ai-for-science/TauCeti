# The Alexander grading as a sum of southwest marking counts

The pairing of a grid point `(c, r)` against the squares occupied by a grid state `m`
(`GridState.JNumCenterAt`) counts the points of `m` weakly northeast of `(c, r)` together with
those strictly southwest of it. Since `m` occupies one point in every column and every row, the
northeast count is determined by the southwest count: writing `southwestCount m c r` for the
number of columns `d < c` with `m d < r`,

`JNumCenterAt m c r + c + r = n + 2 · southwestCount m c r`
(`GridState.JNumCenterAt_add_add`).

Substituting this into the two marking pairings of the Alexander grading formula, the terms that
do not involve the markings cancel between the `O`- and `X`-pairings, and the doubled integer
Alexander grading of a grid state `x` becomes a sum over its columns
(`GridDiagram.alexanderTwoℤ_eq_sum_southwestCount`):

`2 A(x) = 2 ∑_c (southwestCount 𝕏 c (x c) - southwestCount 𝕆 c (x c))
  + ∑_c southwestCount 𝕆 c (𝕆 c) - ∑_c southwestCount 𝕏 c (𝕏 c) - (n - 1)`.

The summands `southwestCount 𝕏 c (x c) - southwestCount 𝕆 c (x c)` are, up to sign, the winding
numbers of the link diagram around the points of `x`; the two remaining sums are the numbers of
non-inversions of the marking permutations (`GridState.I_self_pointSet_eq_sum_southwestCount`).
This is the form in which the Alexander grading of a grid state is compared with that of a
distinguished state, since each summand is bounded by `min c (x c)`
(`GridState.southwestCount_le_min`), with equality for the identity state
(`GridState.southwestCount_of_apply_eq`).

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.GridState.southwestCount`: the number of points of a grid state strictly southwest of
  a grid point.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.GridState.JNumCenterAt_add_add`: the marking pairing of a point is determined by the
  southwest count.
* `TauCeti.GridState.I_self_pointSet_eq_sum_southwestCount`: the non-inversion count of a grid
  state is the sum over its columns of the southwest counts at its own points.
* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.alexanderTwoℤ_eq_sum_southwestCount`: the doubled Alexander grading as a
  sum over columns.

## References

The winding-number form of the Alexander grading is Ozsváth--Stipsicz--Szabó, *Grid Homology for
Knots and Links*, Section 4.7, Proposition 4.7.2. The column-sum form above is that formula with
each winding number written as a difference of southwest counts and with the constant term kept
as the non-inversion counts of the marking permutations.
