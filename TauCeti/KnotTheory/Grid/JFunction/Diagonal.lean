# Pairing the diagonal state against markings

The diagonal grid state pairs against a marked square `(c, r)` with numerator
`min c r + 1 + (n - 1 - max c r)`. Reversing both square coordinates preserves this
number. Thus the diagonal state provides a normalization point for comparing Alexander
gradings under the half-turn of the torus.

The pairing convention is that of Ozsváth--Stipsicz--Szabó, *Grid Homology for Knots and
Links*, Section 4.3: states occupy grid points and markings occupy square centers.
