# The rectangle--pentagon overlap terms of the commutation chain-map equation

Let `C` be a validated column commutation of a grid diagram `G`, replacing the grid line
`b = finRotate n a`. In the chain-map equation of the commutation map, the coefficient of the
commutation map after the original differential counts, among others, the rectangle--pentagon
domains: a rectangle of `G` followed by a pentagon turning on its terminal side `b`. Off the
diagonal, those whose two pieces have a common side column share exactly one, and the common
column occupies one of four positions. Six families, each matched by a recut or by reading the
turn point the other way, cover these positions:

* the common initial side: `GridDiagram.initialOverlapSources`, recut into pentagon--rectangle
  domains;
* the common terminal side, the pentagon starting inside the rectangle's column interval:
  `GridDiagram.terminalCrossOverlapSources`, recut into pentagon--rectangle domains;
* the rectangle starting on `b`, where the pentagon ends, and avoiding the turn row:
  `GridDiagram.leftRightOverlapSources`, recut into pentagon--rectangle domains;
* the rectangle ending where the pentagon starts, the turn row lying in the rows from the
  rectangle's top to the pentagon's top: `GridDiagram.rightLeftOverlapSources`, recut into
  pentagon--rectangle domains;
* the rectangle starting on `b` and spanning the turn row: `GridDiagram.rectanglePentagonTurnCuts`,
  read at the turn point as initial-side-pentagon--rectangle domains;
* the common terminal side, the rectangle starting inside the pentagon's column interval, and the
  remaining domains in which the rectangle ends where the pentagon starts: the two halves of
  `GridDiagram.terminalSelfPairs` (`GridDiagram.mem_terminalSelfPairs_iff_sides`), which recut
  into each other and cancel in characteristic two.

This file shows that these six families partition the off-diagonal overlap terms, so that over a
coefficient ring of characteristic two the total weight of these terms is that of their partners
on the other side of the chain-map equation.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.filter_not_hasDisjointSides_rectanglePentagonDecompositions_eq_union`:
  off the diagonal, the counted rectangle--pentagon domains with a common side column are the
  union of the six families.
* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.sum_rectanglePentagonWeight_overlap_eq_sum_partners`: off the diagonal and
  in characteristic two, the overlap terms of the rectangle--pentagon sum have the total weight of
  the partners of the five cross families, four in the pentagon--rectangle sum and one in the
  initial-side-pentagon--rectangle sum.
