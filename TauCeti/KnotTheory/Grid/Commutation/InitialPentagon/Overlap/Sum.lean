# The rectangle--initial-pentagon overlap terms of the commutation chain-map equation

Let `C` be a validated column commutation of a grid diagram `G`, replacing the grid line
`b = finRotate n a`. In the chain-map equation of the commutation map, the coefficient of the
commutation map after the original differential counts, among others, the
rectangle--initial-side-pentagon domains: a rectangle of `G` followed by a pentagon turning on its
initial side `b`. Off the diagonal, those whose two pieces have a common side column share exactly
one, and the common column occupies one of four positions. Six families, each matched by a recut
or by reading the turn point the other way, cover these positions:

* the common initial side `b`, the pentagon ending inside the rectangle's column interval:
  `GridDiagram.initialPentagonInitialCrossOverlapSources`, recut into initial-side
  pentagon--rectangle domains;
* the common terminal side: `GridDiagram.initialPentagonTerminalOverlapSources`, recut into
  initial-side pentagon--rectangle domains;
* the rectangle starting where the pentagon ends, its recut having the turn row in its first
  rectangle: `GridDiagram.initialPentagonLeftRightOverlapSources`, recut into initial-side
  pentagon--rectangle domains;
* the rectangle ending on `b`, where the pentagon starts, and avoiding the turn row:
  `GridDiagram.initialPentagonRightLeftOverlapSources`, recut into initial-side
  pentagon--rectangle domains;
* the rectangle ending on `b` and spanning the turn row:
  `GridDiagram.rectangleInitialPentagonTurnCuts`, read at the turn point as pentagon--rectangle
  domains;
* the common initial side `b`, the rectangle ending inside the pentagon's column interval, and the
  remaining domains in which the rectangle starts where the pentagon ends: the two halves of
  `GridDiagram.initialPentagonInitialSelfPairs`
  (`GridDiagram.mem_initialPentagonInitialSelfPairs_iff_sides`), which recut into each other and
  cancel in characteristic two.

This file shows that these six families partition the off-diagonal overlap terms, so that over a
coefficient ring of characteristic two the total weight of these terms is that of their partners
on the other side of the chain-map equation.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.
  filter_not_hasDisjointSides_rectangleInitialPentagonDecompositions_eq_union`: off the diagonal,
  the counted rectangle--initial-side-pentagon domains with a common side column are the union of
  the six families.
* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.sum_rectangleInitialPentagonWeight_overlap_eq_sum_partners`: off the
  diagonal and in characteristic two, the overlap terms of the rectangle--initial-side-pentagon
  sum have the total weight of the partners of the five cross families, four in the initial-side
  pentagon--rectangle sum and one in the pentagon--rectangle sum.
