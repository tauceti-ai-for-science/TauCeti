# The mixed partners of initial-side same-sum pairs

Consider a rectangle of the original diagram followed by a commutation pentagon turning on its
initial side, which is the grid line `b = finRotate n a` replaced in the commutation.
`GridDiagram.initialPentagonInitialSelfPairs` collects the counted such domains whose two pieces
share their initial side `b`, the rectangle ending strictly inside the pentagon's column interval,
together with their recuts, which are again rectangle--initial-side-pentagon domains. This file
identifies these recuts without reference to the sources: they are exactly the counted mixed
overlaps in which the rectangle starts where the pentagon ends, with no other common side, and
whose recut does not have the turn row in its first rectangle. These are the mixed `left = right`
overlaps that `GridDiagram.initialPentagonLeftRightOverlapSources` leaves out.

When the first rectangle of the generic recut of such a mixed overlap misses the turn row, the
second recut rectangle starts on `b` and contains the turn row
(`GridRectangleInitialPentagonDecomposition.recutLeftEqRight_turn`), so the recut is again a
rectangle followed by an initial-side pentagon, both starting on `b`. Recutting it returns the
original domain, which does not start on `b`; this forces the recut's rectangle to end strictly
inside its pentagon's column interval. The recut is therefore a same-sum source, its own same-sum
recut is the original domain, and the two cover the same squares with the same multiplicities, so
the recut is counted (`GridDiagram.mem_initialPentagonInitialSelfPairs_of_left_eq_right`).

Conversely, the turn row of a same-sum source lies outside its rectangle's rows: the pentagon's
rows start at the rectangle's top row, which emptiness places strictly between the rectangle's
bottom row and the pentagon's top row
(`GridRectangleInitialPentagonDecomposition.turn_notMem_cIco_first_of_left_eq_left`). The recut of
a source's partner is the source, so no partner is a mixed `left = right` source
(`GridDiagram.mem_initialPentagonInitialSelfPairs_iff_sides`).

## Main results

* `TauCeti.GridRectangleInitialPentagonDecomposition.turn_notMem_cIco_first_of_left_eq_left`: the
  turn row of a domain whose two pieces share exactly their initial side, in particular of a
  same-sum source, lies outside its rectangle's rows.
* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.mem_initialPentagonInitialSelfPairs_of_left_eq_right`: a counted mixed
  `left = right` overlap outside `GridDiagram.initialPentagonLeftRightOverlapSources` is a
  same-sum pair.
* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.mem_initialPentagonInitialSelfPairs_iff_sides`: the same-sum pairs are the
  counted same-sum sources and the counted mixed `left = right` overlaps sharing one side column
  whose recut misses the turn row in its first rectangle.
