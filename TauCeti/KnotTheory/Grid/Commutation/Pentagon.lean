# Pentagons of a column commutation

Let `G` be a grid diagram and let `b = finRotate n a` be the column following column `a`. The
column commutation `G' = G.swapColumns a b` is compared with `G` by drawing both diagrams on one
torus: the vertical grid line `β` between columns `a` and `b` (the line with index `b`) is
replaced by a curve `γ` which meets `β` in two points and bounds with it two thin bigons. The
column-`a` markings of `G` lie in one bigon, on the right of `γ`, and the column-`b` markings in
the other, on the left of `γ`, so that reading the markings off with `γ` in place of `β` gives
`G'`. Every other grid line is shared by the two diagrams, so a grid state of `G'` is again a
permutation of `Fin n` whose value at the line index `b` is its row on `γ`.

A pentagon from a state `x` of `G` to a state `y` of `G'` is an embedded disk bounded by five
arcs: starting at the point of `x` on `β`, it runs left along a horizontal circle to a point of
`y`, down a vertical line to a point of `x`, right along a horizontal circle to the point of `y`
on `γ`, up `γ` to one of the two intersection points of `β` and `γ`, and up `β` back to the start.
All corners are convex, which forces the intersection point to be the one, called the *turn
point*, at which `γ` crosses from the left of `β` to its right going upwards. Just below the turn
point lies the bigon carrying the column-`a` markings, and just above it the bigon carrying the
column-`b` markings.

The combined diagram is recorded by `GridDiagram.ColumnCommutationData`. Besides the adjacent
non-interleaving columns, it records the rows of the two intersections and certifies that the
markings lie in the appropriate two bigons. Every elementary column commutation admits such data
(`GridDiagram.isColumnCommutation_iff_exists_columnCommutationData`), so the map below is
available for each of them. The combinatorics of a pentagon is then recorded
with no curve in sight. Its corners are those of the oriented rectangle from `x` to `y` whose
terminal side is the line `b` (`GridPentagonBetween`, which extends `GridRectangleBetween`); the
turn row must lie in the rows spanned by the terminal side. The lattice points strictly inside
the pentagon are those strictly inside that rectangle,
so emptiness is `GridRectangleBetween.IsEmpty`. The markings it carries differ from those of the
rectangle only in the two columns next to `β` (`GridPentagonBetween.coveredSquares`): a
column-`a` marking is inside exactly when it lies above the turn point, where the terminal side
runs along `β`, and a column-`b` marking exactly when it lies below the turn point, where the
terminal side runs along `γ` to the right of `β`. A column-`a` marking in the row of the turn
point lies below it and a column-`b` marking lies above it, since they lie in the bigons below
and above the turn point respectively.

The pentagon map `GC⁻(G) → GC⁻(G')` (`GridDiagram.pentagonMap`) counts the empty pentagons
carrying no `X`-marking, each weighted by the product of the variables of the `O`-markings it
carries. The variable of an `O`-marking is the one attached to its column in `G'`, so the weight
of a covered column-`c` marking of `G` is `V_{swap a b c}`, and the map is semilinear over the
renaming of the variables by `Equiv.swap a b`. The reverse comparison `GC⁻(G') → GC⁻(G)` counts
pentagons turning at the other intersection point; seen from `G'`, where `γ` is the grid line and
`β` the replacement curve, that is the same construction for `G'` with the square row of the
other intersection point as its turn row.

The pentagons here lie to the left of `β ∪ γ`. The commutation map `Φ` also counts the pentagons
lying to its right, whose initial side turns at the same point; those, and `Φ` itself
(`GridDiagram.commutationMap`), are in `Commutation/InitialPentagon/Basic.lean`. The map defined
here is only one part of `Φ` and is not a chain map on its own.

This file sets up the pentagons and the map. That `Φ` is a chain map, and that together with the
reverse map it is a chain homotopy equivalence via the hexagon-counting homotopies, is not proved
here.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.GridPentagonBetween`: the combinatorial shape of a pentagon, recorded by its corners
  and its turn row.
* `TauCeti.GridPentagonBetween.coveredSquares`: the squares of `G` whose marking lies inside the
  pentagon.
* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.pentagons`: the empty pentagons carrying no `X`-marking.
* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.pentagonWeight`: the monomial weighting a pentagon.
* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.pentagonCoefficient`: the matrix coefficients of the pentagon map.
* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.pentagonMap`: the map `GC⁻(G) → GC⁻(G.swapColumns a b)` counting these
  pentagons, the terminal-side part of the commutation map `Φ`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.GridPentagonBetween.nonempty_iff`: a pentagon from `x` to `y` exists exactly when `y`
  is `x` with column `b` swapped against another column `j` and the turn row lies between the
  rows of `x` on `j` and on `b`; `Subsingleton` records that it is then unique.
* `TauCeti.GridPentagonBetween.mem_coveredSquares`,
  `TauCeti.GridPentagonBetween.mem_coveredSquares_iff_of_ne`: the covered squares, which agree
  with those of the underlying rectangle away from columns `a` and `b`.
  `TauCeti.GridPentagonBetween.mk_mem_coveredSquares_left_column` and
  `TauCeti.GridPentagonBetween.mk_mem_coveredSquares_right_column` give them in those two
  columns.
* `TauCeti.GridPentagonBetween.coveredSquares_eq_product_singleton_of_top_eq_finRotate_bottom`:
  a pentagon spanning one row covers that row away from the first commuted column.
* `TauCeti.GridPentagonBetween.disjoint_coveredSquares_XSet_iff`: the `X`-avoidance condition
  column by column.
* `TauCeti.GridPentagonBetween.coveredSquares_subset_union_of_stacked`: a pentagon spanning a
  pentagon with a rectangle stacked on it covers only squares one of those two covers.
* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.pentagonWeight_eq_prod_coveredSquares`,
  `TauCeti.GridDiagram.pentagonWeight_eq_prod_swapColumns`: the weight as a product over the
  covered squares, and as the product of the variables of the covered `O`-markings of the
  commuted diagram.
* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.pentagonMap_single`, `TauCeti.GridDiagram.pentagonMap_apply_apply`: the
  action of the pentagon map on generators and its matrix coefficients.
* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.pentagonMapOnGenerator_support_subset`: the pentagon map moves a
  generator only by swapping its point on `β` against one other point.

## References

The pentagons are those of the chain map `Φ_{βγ}` of Manolescu--Ozsváth--Szabó--Thurston, *On
combinatorial link Floer homology*, Section 3.1 (arXiv:math/0610559), and of
Ozsváth--Stipsicz--Szabó, *Grid Homology for Knots and Links*, Section 5.1, that lie to the left
of `β ∪ γ`. The orientation convention matches the rectangles of
`TauCeti.GridRectangleBetween`: the source state occupies the lower-left and upper-right
corners.

/-- The combinatorial shape of a pentagon for columns `a` and `finRotate n a`, with turn point in
square row `s`, from a grid state `x` to a grid state `y`.

It is recorded by the oriented rectangle from `x` to `y` with the same corners, whose terminal
side is the grid line `finRotate n a` replaced by the curve `γ`; the rows that side spans must
contain the turn row. The points of `x` sit at the lower-left and upper-right corners and those of
`y` at the upper-left and lower-right corners, the latter on `γ`. A pentagon-counting map only
uses these shapes through `GridDiagram.ColumnCommutationData`, which validates the commutation and
the placement of the markings relative to the turn. -/

/-- The squares of the original diagram whose marking lies inside the pentagon.

Away from the two columns next to the replaced line these are the squares covered by the
underlying rectangle. In column `a` they are the rows strictly above the turn row, up to the top
side, where the terminal side runs along `β`; in column `finRotate n a` they are the rows from
the bottom side up to and excluding the turn row, where the terminal side runs along `γ` to the
right of `β`. The markings of these two columns in the turn row lie below and above the turn
point respectively, and neither is inside the pentagon.

These are the correct squares for the markings of columns `a` and `finRotate n a` when the
turn point is placed as in the combined diagram of the commutation: the column-`a` markings in the
bigon below it and the column-`finRotate n a` markings in the bigon above it. Only marked squares
