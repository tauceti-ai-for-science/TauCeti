# Disjoint double-transposition terms vanish

The square of a grid differential is a sum over pairs of composable rectangles, and the
juxtaposition argument for `∂ ∘ ∂ = 0` splits those pairs according to how many side columns the
two rectangles have in common. Both columns in common is the annular case of `Annulus.lean`, where
the second rectangle returns to the source of the first. This file treats the opposite extreme,
for the fully blocked and the unblocked differential alike: the target state is obtained from the
source by two *disjoint* column transpositions.

That configuration is exactly the disjoint-side case of the case split in `SideOverlap.lean`. Two
disjoint column transpositions move four columns, whereas two transpositions sharing a column move
only three, so every two-step decomposition of such a target has disjoint pairs of side columns.
Reordering the two rectangle moves, `GridRectangleDecomposition.commute`, is then an involution on
the decompositions the unblocked differential counts. Exchanging the two toroidal domains
preserves `X`-avoidance and the weight `V^{O(r)}`. Emptiness is transferred separately by
`isEmpty_commute_first` and `isEmpty_commute_second`, using the cyclic-separation lemma
`Grid.mem_cIoo_and_mem_cIoo_swap_of_notMem`. Reordering also changes the intermediate state, so
it has no fixed point. In characteristic two the paired terms cancel.

The shared bookkeeping in `Count.lean` first reindexes the two-step terms as a single sum
over the finite set of decompositions both of whose rectangles the unblocked differential counts.
That reindexing holds for every pair of grid states and coefficient ring, so it serves the
intermediate case of two rectangles sharing exactly one side column,
`GridRectangleDecomposition.HasOneCommonSide`, just as well.

## Main results

The following results are in the `TauCeti.GridDiagram` namespace.

* `fullyBlockedDifferential_sq_single_apply_swapColumns_swapColumns_eq_zero_of_disjoint`: the
  fully blocked differential-square entry for two disjoint column transpositions vanishes.
* `unblockedDecompositionWeight_commute`: commuting a disjoint-side
  decomposition preserves its unblocked weight.
* `commute_mem_unblockedDecompositions_iff` and `commute_mem_fullyBlockedDecompositions_iff`:
  commuting preserves whether the unblocked, respectively fully blocked, differential counts a
  decomposition.
* `sum_unblockedCoefficient_mul_unblockedCoefficient_swapColumns_swapColumns_eq_zero_of_disjoint`:
  the weighted sum for two disjoint column transpositions vanishes in characteristic two.
* `unblockedDifferential_sq_single_apply_swapColumns_swapColumns_eq_zero_of_disjoint`: in
  characteristic two, that entry vanishes when the target is the source with two disjoint column
  transpositions applied.
