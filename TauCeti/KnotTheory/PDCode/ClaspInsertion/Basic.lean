# Algebraic clasp insertion in PD-codes

The code-level tangle replacement underlying the second Reidemeister move creates two crossings
at which the same strand is over. On a PD-code with `n` crossings,
`TauCeti.PDCode.insertClasp D p q b hqp hqe` performs this algebraic clasp insertion on two
distinct arcs: the arc `P` ending at the half-edge `p` and the arc `Q` ending at the half-edge
`q`. Both arcs are cut open and routed through the two new crossings. These are the last two,
`(Fin.last n).castSucc` (the first crossing, reached from `p` and `q`) and `Fin.last (n + 1)`
(the second crossing, reached from the other ends of the two arcs).

With the slots of a crossing in counterclockwise order, the strand along `P` occupies slots `0`
and `2` of the first crossing and slots `1` and `3` of the second, and the strand along `Q`
occupies slots `1` and `3` of the first crossing and slots `0` and `2` of the second. The arcs are:
`p` to slot `0` and `q` to slot `1` of the first crossing; slot `3` of the second crossing to the
other end of `P` and slot `2` to the other end of `Q`; and the two short arcs of the clasp, from
slot `2` of the first crossing to slot `1` of the second (along `P`) and from slot `3` of the
first crossing to slot `0` of the second (along `Q`). The Boolean `b` is the over-pair indicator
of the first crossing, and the second crossing gets `!b`, so that the same strand is over at both:
with `b = false` it is the strand along `P`.

Of the four ways to smooth the two new crossings, one smooths them back into the two original
arcs. The other three all reconnect the cut ends instead, `p` to `q` and the other end of `P` to
the other end of `Q`, and one of these three also cuts off the circle through the two short arcs
of the clasp. The first state and the circle-cutting one carry weight `1` in the Kauffman
bracket, and the other two weights `a ^ 2` and `a⁻¹ ^ 2`; since `a ^ 2 + a⁻¹ ^ 2 + δ = 0` for the
loop value `δ = -(a ^ 2 + a⁻¹ ^ 2)`, the reconnected terms cancel, so the clasp insertion leaves
the **Kauffman bracket invariant**. The insertion also keeps the number of components.

On its own the insertion is an algebraic operation on the code: nothing forces the two arcs to
border a common region of the diagram. An arc borders a face of `TauCeti.PDCode.face` on each
side, the face at each of its two ends: `P` borders the faces at `p` and at `D.edgePair.val p`.
Going round the clasp counterclockwise, its four outer ends are met in the order `p`, `q`,
`D.edgePair.val q`, `D.edgePair.val p`, so it can be drawn inside a face bordered by both arcs
when the face at the far end `D.edgePair.val p` of `P` is the face at `q`, that is, when `P` and
`Q` border a common face on the side of `D.edgePair.val p` and of `q` respectively. Every common
face of the two arcs is of this form for a suitable choice of the ends passed as `p` and `q`; for
instance, passing `D.edgePair.val q` instead of `q` uses the other side of `Q`. Under this face
condition the insertion is the **second Reidemeister move**: the clasp cuts that face in two and
adds the bigon between its two crossings, so the code gets two more faces
(`TauCeti.PDCode.faceCount_insertClasp_of_face_eq`), its underlying graph keeps its connected
components, and it is planar exactly when `D` is (`TauCeti.PDCode.isPlanar_insertClasp_iff`). The
face condition cannot be dropped: if the two arcs lie in one connected component but the face at
`D.edgePair.val p` is not the face at `q`, the clasp joins two faces into one, which its bigon
only makes up for, and the new code is never planar
(`TauCeti.PDCode.not_isPlanar_insertClasp_of_face_ne`). When the two arcs instead lie in distinct
crossing-graph components, the clasp joins exactly those two components and preserves planarity
(`TauCeti.PDCode.isPlanar_insertClasp_iff_of_not_mem_orbit`). The insertion applies only to codes
with a crossing; an insertion involving a crossing-free circle is not treated here.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.PDCode.insertClasp`: algebraically insert a two-crossing clasp into two arcs.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.PDCode.crossingComponentCount_insertClasp`: the insertion keeps the number of
  components.
* `TauCeti.PDCode.kauffmanBracket_insertClasp`: the insertion leaves the Kauffman bracket
  unchanged.
* `TauCeti.PDCode.mirror_insertClasp`: mirroring the new code inserts the clasp with the other
  strand over into the mirror code.
* `TauCeti.PDCode.faceCount_insertClasp_of_face_eq` and
  `TauCeti.PDCode.faceCount_insertClasp_of_face_ne`: the insertion adds two faces when the face
  at `D.edgePair.val p` is the face at `q`, and none otherwise.
* `TauCeti.PDCode.card_monodromyOrbit_insertClasp`: the insertion keeps the connected components
  of the underlying graph when the two arcs lie in one of them.
* `TauCeti.PDCode.card_monodromyOrbit_insertClasp_add_one_of_not_mem_orbit`: a clasp between
  different crossing-graph components merges exactly two components.
* `TauCeti.PDCode.isPlanar_insertClasp_iff_of_not_mem_orbit`: such a clasp preserves planarity.
* `TauCeti.PDCode.isPlanar_insertClasp_iff`: when the face at `D.edgePair.val p` is the face at
  `q`, the clasp keeps the code planar, and `TauCeti.PDCode.not_isPlanar_insertClasp_of_face_ne`:
  otherwise, between arcs of one component, it never yields a planar code.

/-! ### The arcs of a clasp, on the old half-edges and the slots of two new crossings

A clasp's arcs are built as an involution of `(α ⊕ Fin 4) ⊕ Fin 4`: `α` holds the old half-edges,
the middle `Fin 4` the slots of the first new crossing, and the last `Fin 4` those of the second.
With `e` the old arcs, the arcs from `p` to `e p` and from `q` to `e q` are cut and routed through
the slots. These helpers serve only the proofs in this file. -/

second, slots `2` and `3` of the first crossing to slots `1` and `0` of the second, and every
other half-edge to its old partner. -/

/-- **Algebraic clasp insertion**: route the arc of `D` ending at the half-edge `p` and the
distinct arc ending at `q` through a two-crossing clasp. This operation carries no claim that the
two arcs border a common face. When the face at the far end `D.edgePair.val p` of the first arc is
the face at `q`, that is, `D.face (D.edgePair.val p) = D.face q`, it is the second Reidemeister
move (`TauCeti.PDCode.isPlanar_insertClasp_iff`); passing `D.edgePair.val q` instead of `q` uses
the other side of the second arc.
The two new crossings are `(Fin.last n).castSucc`, whose slots `0`
and `1` are joined to `p` and `q`, and `Fin.last (n + 1)`, whose slots `3` and `2` are joined to
the other ends `D.edgePair.val p` and `D.edgePair.val q` of the two arcs. Slot `2` of the first
new crossing is joined to slot `1` of the second along the first strand, and slot `3` to slot `0`
along the second. The over-pair indicators of the two new crossings are `b` and `!b`: with
`b = false` the strand through `p` is over at both, with `b = true` the strand through `q`. -/
