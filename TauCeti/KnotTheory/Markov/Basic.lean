# Markov moves and Markov equivalence of braids

Closing up a braid on `n` strands, by joining the `i`-th endpoint at the top to the `i`-th
endpoint at the bottom, presents an oriented link. After forgetting its framing, two such braids,
possibly on different numbers of strands, close to isotopic oriented links exactly when they are
related by a chain of the two *Markov moves*:
conjugation `b ↦ c * b * c⁻¹` inside a fixed braid group, and stabilization
`b ↦ strandIncl b * (σ_last)^(±1)`, which adds a strand and crosses it once, in either sense,
with the previous one. That is Markov's theorem; only the moves, not the theorem, are formalized
here, since the link presentation the theorem is stated against does not exist yet.

This file introduces framed braid-closure data and its forgetful map, the unframed
braids-of-any-width that the ordinary Markov moves act on, the equivalence relation
`TauCeti.MarkovEquiv` they generate, and the first invariant of that relation: the number of
components of the closure. It does not yet define the equivalence relation on framed braid
closures; ordinary stabilization changes the blackboard framing.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.MarkovBraid`: a braid together with the number of strands it is a braid on.
* `TauCeti.FramedMarkovBraid`: a braid closure with an integer framing coefficient on each
  component; its `forgetFraming` projection drops those coefficients.
* `TauCeti.MarkovBraid.componentCount`: the number of components of the closure of the braid,
  computed as the number of orbits of the underlying permutation of the strands.
* `TauCeti.IsMarkovMove`: the generating moves, three constructors for the two moves —
  conjugation, and stabilization in each of its two signs.
* `TauCeti.MarkovEquiv`: Markov equivalence, the equivalence relation they generate.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.MarkovBraid.componentCount_conj`, `TauCeti.MarkovBraid.componentCount_stabilize` and
  `TauCeti.MarkovBraid.componentCount_stabilizeInv`: each move separately preserves the number of
  components of the closure.
* `TauCeti.MarkovEquiv.componentCount_eq`: Markov-equivalent braids have closures with the same
  number of components. This is the invariant that keeps the relation from being everything.
* `TauCeti.markovEquiv_sigma_last_one_one`: the trivial braid on one strand and the single
  crossing `σ₀` on two strands are Markov equivalent.
* `TauCeti.not_markovEquiv_one_of_ne`: trivial braids on different numbers of strands are *not*
  Markov equivalent.
* `TauCeti.not_markovEquiv_sigma_last_one_two`: the single crossing and the trivial braid on two
  strands are not Markov equivalent.
* `TauCeti.MarkovEquiv.equivalence`: Markov equivalence is an equivalence relation.
* `TauCeti.MarkovEquiv.induction`: the induction principle that makes the `Prop`-valued
  definition of Markov equivalence usable outside this file.

## Implementation notes

A braid on `n` strands is `TauCeti.BraidGroup n`, a different type for each `n`, while the
stabilization move leaves that type; so the moves are stated on the total space
`TauCeti.MarkovBraid`, whose field `predStrands` records the strand count minus one. Every link
that is a braid closure is the closure of a braid on at least one strand, and the stabilization
move needs a strand to cross the new one with, so `predStrands + 1` rather than `predStrands` is
the strand count.

The component count is read off the underlying permutation `TauCeti.BraidGroup.permHom`: in the
closure, the strand ending at position `i` is joined to the strand starting at position `i`, so
the components of the closure are exactly the orbits of that permutation on the strands. Its
invariance under stabilization is where the work is, and it is supplied by
`TauCeti/GroupTheory/Perm/OrbitCount/Basic.lean`: stabilization adjoins a fixed point to the
underlying permutation and immediately splices it into an existing orbit.

This advances Layer 4 ("knot theory, done properly") of the geometric-topology roadmap
(`TauCetiRoadmap/GeometricTopology/README.md`), which asks for framed and oriented presentations,
the forgetful maps between them, the equivalence attached to each presentation -- "Markov moves
(braids)" -- and "braid-to-diagram via Markov" as an edge of the spanning tree of presentations.
The relation in this file is specifically the ordinary unframed relation after applying
`TauCeti.FramedMarkovBraid.forgetFraming`; framing-preserving Markov equivalence remains future
work.
