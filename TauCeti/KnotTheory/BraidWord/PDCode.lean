# The closure of a braid word as a PD-code

Closing a braid, by joining the top end of each strand position to its bottom end, presents an
oriented link. This file writes that link down as an oriented PD-code, with one crossing for
every letter of a braid word. It is the combinatorial edge from the braid presentation of a
link to the diagram presentation.

The braid is drawn with its strands running upwards, the letters of the word from the bottom to
the top, and the closing strands passing to the side. The four slots of the crossing of a
letter `(i, ε)` are, counterclockwise: slot `0` entering from below on position `i + 1`, slot `1`
leaving above on position `i + 1`, slot `2` leaving above on position `i`, and slot `3` entering
from below on position `i`. So the strand entering on position `i` occupies slots `3` and `1`;
it is the over-strand when `ε = 1`, which makes the crossing positive, and the under-strand when
`ε = -1`. Leaving a crossing upwards on position `p`, a strand next meets the first crossing
above it that involves position `p`, or else runs through the closure back to the lowest such
crossing; that successor is `TauCeti.BraidWord.nextCrossing`. A position involved in no crossing
closes up to a crossing-free circle.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.BraidWord.crossingsAt`: the crossings involving a strand position, from the bottom.
* `TauCeti.BraidWord.nextCrossing`: the next crossing met along a strand position.
* `TauCeti.BraidWord.closure`: the oriented PD-code of the closure of a braid word.
* `TauCeti.BraidWord.crossinglessPosition`: the strand position of a crossing-free circle of the
  closure.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.BraidWord.crossingsAt_cons`: a letter added at the bottom of a word comes first along
  its two strand positions.
* `TauCeti.BraidWord.edgePair_closure_outgoingSlot`: the arcs of the closure join each crossing
  to the next crossing along the same strand position.
* `TauCeti.BraidWord.edgePair_closure_incomingSlot`: the same arcs, read from the crossing they
  enter.
* `TauCeti.BraidWord.edgePair_closure_crossingSlotEquiv_zero` and its siblings for the slots `1`,
  `2` and `3`: the arc at each slot of a crossing of the closure.
* `TauCeti.BraidWord.edgePair_closure_eq_of_outgoingSlot`: a perfect matching of the half-edges
  agreeing with the arcs of the closure at the slots where strands leave their crossings is the arc
  matching of the closure.
* `TauCeti.BraidWord.crossingSign_closure`: the sign of each crossing is the sign of its letter.
* `TauCeti.BraidWord.writhe_closure`: the writhe of the closure is the exponent sum of the braid.
* `TauCeti.BraidWord.range_crossinglessPosition`: the crossing-free circles of the closure are the
  strand positions crossed by no letter.
* `TauCeti.BraidWord.closure_nil`: the closure of the empty word on `n` strands is the
  `n`-component unlink.
