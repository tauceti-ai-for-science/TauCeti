# Analytic root sections of delineations

A delineation of a polynomial family with intrinsically analytic coefficients over an analytic
submanifold has intrinsically analytic root functions. Multiplicities may be greater than one:
constant positive multiplicity, already part of a delineation, suffices. Consequently every
ambient section of the stack is an analytic submanifold of the same dimension as the base.

The analyticity statement is expressed using any ambient function agreeing with the root
function on the base. This matches `AnalyticOnSubmanifold`, which depends only on values on the
submanifold, and imposes no regularity on the function away from the base.
