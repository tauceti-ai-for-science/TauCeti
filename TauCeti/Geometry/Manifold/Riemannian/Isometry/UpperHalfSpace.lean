# The isometry group of the upper half-space model

For `R ≠ 0` and a point `(a, 0)` of the boundary hyperplane `E × {0}`, the Euclidean inversion
`x ↦ (a, 0) + (R / ‖x - (a, 0)‖) ^ 2 • (x - (a, 0))` preserves the open upper half-space of
`E × ℝ`. It scales tangent vectors and the height `t` by the same factor
`(R / ‖x - (a, 0)‖) ^ 2`, so it is an isometry of the hyperbolic metric `(‖dx‖² + dt²) / t²`.

Together with the similarities `(x, t) ↦ (c • A x + b, c • t)` of
`TauCeti.UpperHalfSpace.similarity`, these inversions exhaust the isometry group of the upper
half-space model when `E` is finite-dimensional: every isometry is a similarity, or a similarity
followed by one inversion. This is the classical description of the isometries of hyperbolic space
in the upper half-space model as the Möbius transformations preserving the upper half-space,
written in an explicit normal form.
With `E = EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 2)` it describes the full isometry group of the hyperbolic model
geometry `ℍ³`.

The classification uses that an isometry of a connected Riemannian manifold is determined by its
value and differential at one point (`TauCeti.RiemannianIsometry.ext_of_mfderiv_eq`). After a
similarity, an isometry fixes `(0, 1)`, where the hyperbolic metric is the Euclidean one, so its
differential there is a linear isometry of `E × ℝ`. If that differential fixes the vertical unit
vector, it is the differential of a linear similarity; otherwise it is the differential of a
linear similarity followed by the inversion in the sphere through `(0, 1)` whose differential
exchanges the vertical vector with its image.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.UpperHalfSpace.inversion`: the inversion in the sphere of radius `|R|` centred at the
  boundary point `(a, 0)`, as an isometry of the upper half-space model.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.UpperHalfSpace.tangentSpaceCastModel_mfderiv_inversion`: the differential of an
  inversion is a positive multiple of a reflection.
* `TauCeti.UpperHalfSpace.inversion_mul_self`: inversions are involutions.
* `TauCeti.UpperHalfSpace.exists_eq_similarity_or_exists_eq_inversion_mul_similarity`: every
  isometry of the upper half-space model with finite-dimensional `E` is a similarity or an
  inversion composed with a similarity.

/-- **Isometries of the upper half-space model.** When `E` is finite-dimensional, every isometry
of the upper half-space model of hyperbolic space is either a similarity
`(x, t) ↦ (c • A x + b, c • t)` or such a similarity followed by the inversion in a sphere centred
on the boundary hyperplane `t = 0`. -/
