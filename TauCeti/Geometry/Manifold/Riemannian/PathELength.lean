# Smooth paths with prescribed Riemannian path length

For a `C¹` path on `[0, 1]`, there exists a globally `C¹` path that is constant near both
endpoints, has the same endpoints, and has exactly the same `Manifold.pathELength`. For two `C¹`
paths with a common endpoint, there likewise exists a globally `C¹` path between their outer
endpoints whose length is the sum of their lengths. These are the basic existential properties
needed to compare piecewise-`C¹` and `C¹` definitions of Riemannian distance.

The reparametrizations do not introduce new points: the smoothed path stays in the image of the
original path, and a smoothed concatenation stays in the union of the two original images. This
range control allows local length estimates to be applied after smoothing a path inside a fixed
open set.

A path on an arbitrary compact interval can first be reparametrized affinely onto `[0, 1]`
without changing its endpoints or length.

The construction uses Mathlib's `Real.smoothTransition` and
`Manifold.pathELength_comp_of_monotoneOn`. No new notion of path length is introduced.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.exists_contMDiff_pathELength_eq`: obtain a globally `C¹` path, constant near its
  endpoints, with the same endpoints, length, and image containment as a given `C¹` path.
* `TauCeti.Manifold.exists_contMDiff_pathELength_eq_of_le`: reparametrize a `C¹` path from an
  arbitrary compact interval onto `[0, 1]`, preserving its endpoints and length.
* `TauCeti.exists_contMDiff_pathELength_eq_add`: obtain a globally `C¹` path between the outer
  endpoints of two compatible `C¹` paths, with length equal to the sum of their lengths.
* `TauCeti.Manifold.pathELength_lineMap`: the straight segment between two points of an inner
  product space has length equal to the norm distance between them.
