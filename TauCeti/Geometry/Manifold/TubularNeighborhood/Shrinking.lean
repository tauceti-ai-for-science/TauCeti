# Shrinking tubular neighbourhoods inside the normal bundle

A Euclidean tubular neighbourhood can be chosen so that its closed normal discs lie in
any prescribed open neighbourhood of the zero section in the normal bundle. At the same
time, the ambient closed balls fit inside a prescribed neighbourhood of the embedded image.
The radius is positive and smooth, and normal addition remains an open embedding.

This is the shrinking step for assembling smooth tubular inverses: choose a zero-section
neighbourhood on which normal addition is a local diffeomorphism, then shrink the globally
injective tube into it. The normal bundle retains its topology induced from `M × V`.
