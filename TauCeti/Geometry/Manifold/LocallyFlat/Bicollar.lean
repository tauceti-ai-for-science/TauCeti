# Locally flat embeddings are locally bicollared

A locally flat embedding is one that ambient charts flatten onto the standard coordinate slice
(`TauCeti.IsLocallyFlat`). This file extracts from those charts the structure they were isolated
to provide: near each point of the domain, an open neighbourhood of the image that is a *product*,
with the image sitting inside it as the zero slice.

In codimension one that structure is a **bicollar**: an open embedding `b : N × ℝ → M` with
`b (x, 0) = f x`, so that the image is two-sided inside the open set the collar sweeps out. This
is the notion Brown's collaring theorem is about, and the reason local flatness is the hypothesis
under which topological manifolds behave: the Alexander horned sphere is an embedded `2`-sphere in
`S³` that is *not* locally bicollared because it has wild points at which no neighbourhood pair is
homeomorphic to the standard coordinate-slice pair.

The file proves both directions of the comparison.

* **Local flatness gives local bicollars.** The general local-product theorem
  `TauCeti.IsLocallyFlat.exists_isOpenEmbedding_prod` from `LocallyFlat.Basic`, specialised to a
  one-dimensional complementary model, gives `TauCeti.IsLocallyFlat.isLocallyBicollared`.
* **A bicollar is a local flattening.** `TauCeti.IsBicollar.isLocallyFlat` runs the comparison
  backwards: a collared map factors through the standard slice `N → N × ℝ`, which is locally flat
  once `N` is charted on `F`, and local flatness is stable under composing with an open embedding.
  Needing the domain to be charted on `F` is where the "an `(n-1)`-manifold in an `n`-manifold" of
  the informal statement enters.

Together they give `TauCeti.isLocallyFlat_iff_isEmbedding_and_isLocallyBicollared`: over a domain
charted on `F`, a map is locally flat with one-dimensional complementary model exactly when it is
an embedding that is locally bicollared. The embedding hypothesis cannot be dropped: a
figure-eight immersion of a line into the plane is locally bicollared and is not an embedding,
since bicollars only see the domain locally.

This is the codimension-one collaring bullet of layer 2 of the geometric-topology roadmap
(`TauCetiRoadmap/GeometricTopology/README.md`). What remains of that bullet is its global sphere
conclusion: a locally flat `(n-1)`-sphere in `Sⁿ` is bicollared. That conclusion needs a genuinely
global collaring argument and is not proved here. Positive-codimension normal bundles, the
companion notion, are flagged by the roadmap as a dependency to be taken from elsewhere rather
than built in this layer.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.IsBicollar`: an open embedding `N × ℝ → M` whose zero slice is a given map.
* `TauCeti.IsBicollared`: admitting a bicollar.
* `TauCeti.IsLocallyBicollared`: every point of the domain has an open neighbourhood on which the
  restriction is bicollared.

The last two are `def`s whose bodies the module system does not expose, so
`TauCeti.isBicollared_iff` and `TauCeti.isLocallyBicollared_iff` are the only way to introduce or
eliminate them downstream.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.IsLocallyFlat.isLocallyBicollared`: **a locally flat embedding of codimension one is
  locally bicollared.**
* `TauCeti.IsBicollar.isLocallyFlat`, `TauCeti.IsLocallyBicollared.isLocallyFlat` and
  `TauCeti.isLocallyFlat_iff_isEmbedding_and_isLocallyBicollared`: the converse, and the resulting
  characterisation.
* `TauCeti.IsBicollar.range_diff_range_eq_union` and
  `TauCeti.IsBicollar.disjoint_image_Ioi_Iio`: the two sides of a bicollar are disjoint and cover
  the complement of the image inside the collar.
* `TauCeti.IsBicollared.exists_isOpen_sdiff_range_eq_union`: a bicollared map with nonempty
  domain is two-sided.
* `TauCeti.IsLocallyBicollared.restrict`, `TauCeti.IsLocallyBicollared.isOpenEmbedding_comp`, and
  `TauCeti.IsLocallyBicollared.comp_homeomorph`: the local predicate's basic closure API.

### Bicollars
-/

/-- A **bicollar** of a map `f : N → M` is an open embedding `b : N × ℝ → M` whose zero slice is
`f`. It exhibits an open neighbourhood of the image of `f` as a product of `N` with a line, in
which the image is the zero slice; in particular the image is two-sided inside that
neighbourhood. -/
