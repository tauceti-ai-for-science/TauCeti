# Transport of involutive distributions

A diffeomorphism whose differential identifies two distributions preserves involutivity.
This allows involutivity to be checked in diffeomorphic coordinate models when constructing
integral manifolds. In particular, a distribution is involutive if and only if its pullback
by a diffeomorphism is involutive.

The vector-field pullback and Lie-bracket naturality APIs are provided by Mathlib.

`TauCeti.IsInvolutiveDistribution.diffeomorph` gives the forward transport theorem, and
`Diffeomorph.isInvolutiveDistribution_iff` gives the equivalence for identified distributions.
`Diffeomorph.isInvolutiveDistribution_comap_mfderiv_iff` gives the pullback characterization.

The distributions remain families of tangent subspaces, and their pullback is expressed using
`Submodule.comap`. No regularity or constant-rank assumption on the distribution is needed.
The diffeomorphism must be at least `C²` over the reals (`minSmoothness 𝕜 2` over a general
scalar field), so that pullbacks of differentiable vector fields are differentiable and their
Lie brackets transform naturally.
