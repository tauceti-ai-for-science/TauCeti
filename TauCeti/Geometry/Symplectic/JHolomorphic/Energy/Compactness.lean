# Small-energy interior compactness for pseudoholomorphic curves

For a `C²` almost complex structure on a neighbourhood of a compact set `K`, curves with image
in `K` and sufficiently small energy have a common Lipschitz bound on the concentric half disk.
Consequently every sequence of such curves has a uniformly convergent subsequence there. The
limit takes values in `K` and is Lipschitz. No differentiability or pseudoholomorphicity of the
limit is asserted: these require elliptic regularity.

The energy used here is `∫ ‖∂ₛu‖²`, with `∂ₛu = fderiv ℝ u z 1`. The equation
`∂ₜu = J(u) ∂ₛu` controls the other derivative. Integrability on the outer open disk is explicit,
so a nonintegrable energy density cannot acquire the Bochner integral's junk value zero.
The energy threshold is independent of the disk's centre and radius. The common Lipschitz
constant may depend on the radius but not on the centre or the curve.

This is the local compactness input away from energy concentration in bubbling arguments.
It combines the energy-density mean-value estimate in
`TauCeti.Geometry.Symplectic.JHolomorphic.Energy.MeanValue` with Mathlib's Arzelà–Ascoli theorem.
