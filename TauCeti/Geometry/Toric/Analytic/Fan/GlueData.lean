# The analytic realization of a regular fan

The affine analytic charts of a regular fan, their pairwise overlap loci and the transitions
between them form gluing data for topological spaces in the sense of `TopCat.GlueData`. This
file assembles that gluing data and defines the analytic realization of the fan as the glued
space `TopCat.GlueData.glued`. Every affine chart is an open subspace of the realization, the
charts cover it, and points of two charts are identified exactly when they come from a common
point of the chart of the intersection cone.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.Toric.Fan.analyticGlueData`: the gluing data of the affine analytic charts of a
  regular fan along their overlap transitions.
* `TauCeti.Toric.Fan.analyticRealization`: the analytic realization of a regular fan, the glued
  space of this gluing data.
* `TauCeti.Toric.Fan.analyticAffineChartι`: the inclusion of an affine analytic chart into the
  realization, an open embedding by `TauCeti.Toric.Fan.isOpenEmbedding_analyticAffineChartι`.
* `TauCeti.Toric.Fan.analyticAffineChartι_faceAffinePointMap`: face-localization maps commute
  with the chart inclusions into the realization.
* `TauCeti.Toric.Fan.exists_analyticAffineChartι_apply_eq`: the affine charts cover the
  realization.
* `TauCeti.Toric.Fan.analyticAffineChartι_eq_analyticAffineChartι_iff`: points of two charts are
  identified exactly along the chart of the intersection cone.
* `TauCeti.Toric.Fan.isOpen_iff_forall_preimage_analyticAffineChartι`: a subset of the
  realization is open exactly when its preimage in every chart is open.

## Implementation notes

The gluing data is built with `TopCat.GlueData.mk'`, whose index type and spaces live in one
universe, so the lattice `N` and the real vector space `V` are taken in a common universe here.
The gluing data is exposed so that its index type and charts are definitionally the cones and the
affine analytic charts, which is what lets the chart inclusions be stated on the objects of
`TauCeti.Toric.Fan.analyticAffineChartDiagram` and lets the `TopCat.GlueData` API be applied at a
cone.
