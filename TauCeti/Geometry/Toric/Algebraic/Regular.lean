# Regular toric cones and regular fans

A toric cone is *regular*, or smooth, when its primitive ray generators can be completed to a
single integral basis of the lattice. This is the combinatorial condition under which the affine
chart of the cone is a mixed chart `ℂ ^ k × (ℂ ^ *) ^ (n - k)` rather than a singular affine toric
variety, so it is the hypothesis carried by the downstream mixed-chart and complex-manifold
constructions.

Regularity is defined here as the conjunction of `TauCeti.Toric.IsToricCone` with the existence of
an *extending basis*: an integral basis `b` of the lattice together with an injection `r` of the
rays of the cone into the basis indices such that `b (r ρ)` is the primitive generator of the ray
`ρ`. The toric-cone hypothesis separately enforces lattice rationality, salience, and finite
generation; the basis condition alone would be vacuous whenever the cone's `ToricRay` type is
empty.

Two extending bases of the same cone cannot differ at the ray indices, because a ray of a toric
cone in an integral lattice has only one primitive generator. This pins the block form of the
transition matrix between two extending bases: every ray column is a standard column supported at
the matching ray row, so splitting the index set of each basis into its rays and a common
complement, compatibly with the two ray indexings, the matrix is `[[1, B], [0, D]]` with `D`
unimodular. The analytic layer consumes exactly this shape: changing the extending basis keeps the
boundary coordinates, twists them by `B`, and acts on the torus coordinates by `D`.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.Toric.IsExtendingBasis`: an integral basis whose vectors at the ray indices are the
  primitive ray generators.
* `TauCeti.Toric.IsRegularCone`: a toric cone admitting an extending basis.
* `TauCeti.Toric.isRegularCone_bot`: the zero cone, whose affine chart is the dense torus, is
  regular.
* `TauCeti.Toric.isRegularCone_hull_singleton`: the cone spanned by a primitive lattice vector,
  whose affine chart is the mixed chart `ℂ × (ℂ ^ *) ^ (n - 1)` with a single boundary coordinate,
  is regular.
* `TauCeti.Toric.IsRegularCone.of_isFaceOf` and `TauCeti.Toric.IsRegularCone.face`: a face of a
  regular cone is regular. Since the pairwise intersections of the cones of a fan are faces, this
  also makes the overlaps of the affine charts of a regular fan regular.
* `TauCeti.Toric.IsRegularCone.prod`: a product of regular cones is regular for the product lattice
  map.
* `TauCeti.Toric.IsRegularCone.card_toricRay_le_finrank`: a regular cone has at most as many rays
  as the rank of the lattice, which is the count that gives the dimensions of its mixed chart.
* `TauCeti.Toric.IsRegularCone.exists_basis_sum`: an extending basis indexed by the rays followed
  by a finite complementary type, as required by regular affine coordinates.
* `TauCeti.Toric.IsExtendingBasis.basis_apply_eq`,
  `TauCeti.Toric.IsExtendingBasis.repr_basis_apply` and
  `TauCeti.Toric.IsExtendingBasis.toMatrix_apply`: the salient ray columns of the transition matrix
  relating two extending bases.
* `TauCeti.Toric.isUnit_det_toMatrix_submatrix_inr`: for two bases indexed by a splitting of the
  index set into the rays of the cone and a common complement, both extending the primitive ray
  generators, the complementary block of the transition matrix is unimodular.
* `TauCeti.Toric.IsExtendingBasis.isUnit_det_toMatrix_compl` and
  `TauCeti.Toric.IsExtendingBasis.exists_isUnit_det_toMatrix_compl`: the complementary block of
  that transition matrix is unimodular, for compatible splittings of the two index sets into the
  rays and a common complement, and such a splitting exists.
* `TauCeti.Toric.Fan.IsRegular`: a fan all of whose cones are regular, together with the
  regularity of the fan of a regular cone and of subfans.

## Implementation notes

`TauCeti.Toric.IsRegularCone` extends `TauCeti.Toric.IsToricCone`, so lattice rationality,
salience and finite generation of a regular cone are reached by dot notation through the parent
structure rather than by forwarding lemmas.

The index type of an extending basis is `Fin n` for an unconstrained `n` rather than
`Fin (Module.finrank ℤ N)`. The two are interchangeable, since `Module.finrank_eq_card_basis`
identifies `n` with the rank and `TauCeti.Toric.IsRegularCone.exists_basis_finrank` produces the
second form on demand, but the unconstrained index avoids transporting a basis along an equality
of natural numbers every time one is built.
