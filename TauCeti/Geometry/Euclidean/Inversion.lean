# Analytic inversion, its isometry compatibility, and orientation

Inversion is analytic away from its centre (`EuclideanGeometry.contDiffAt_inversion`). This
extends the smooth regularity provided by Mathlib's `ContDiffAt.inversion` to the analytic order.

Inversion in a sphere (`EuclideanGeometry.inversion c R`) is defined from the distance to the
centre and the vector from the centre, both of which an affine isometry preserves. So an affine
isometry carries the inversion in a sphere to the inversion in the image sphere, and a linear
isometry fixing the centre commutes with the inversion. This is the compatibility used to compare
inversion charts of the closed unit balls of two inner product spaces along a linear isometry.

For a nonzero radius `R`, the derivative of the inversion at a point `x ≠ c` is a positive
multiple of the reflection in the hyperplane orthogonal to `x - c` (`hasFDerivAt_inversion`), so
in finite dimension its determinant is negative: inversion reverses orientation. A transition
between two inversion charts whose linear isometries lie in the same orientation class is a
composite of two inversions and a linear isometry of positive determinant, so it preserves
orientation. This is how the inversion charts of the closed unit ball attached to the isometries
of one orientation class give an oriented atlas.

## Main results

* `EuclideanGeometry.contDiffAt_inversion`: inversion is analytic away from its centre.
* `TauCeti.snd_inversion`: the last coordinate of inversion about a centre in `E × {0}`.
* `AffineIsometry.map_inversion`: an affine isometry carries inversion in the sphere of centre `c`
  and radius `R` to inversion in the sphere of centre `f c` and radius `R`.
* `LinearIsometry.map_inversion`: the same for a linear isometry.
* `EuclideanGeometry.det_fderiv_inversion_neg`: the derivative of an inversion has negative
  determinant.
