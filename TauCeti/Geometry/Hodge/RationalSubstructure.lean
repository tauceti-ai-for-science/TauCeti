# Rational substructures of pure Hodge structures

A rational Hodge substructure is a rational subspace whose complexification is spanned by its
intersections with the Hodge components. This file packages that condition and equips the
complexified subspace with the pure Hodge structure it inherits from the ambient one, so that the
whole `HodgeStructureOn` API applies to it — in particular the Hodge decomposition of the
complexified subspace into its own components is `HodgeStructureOn.isInternal_piece`, not a second
copy of that argument.

Conjugation stability of the complexification is not a field of the structure: it holds for every
rational subspace, by `rationalToComplexSubmodule_conj`. Together with the spanning condition this
exhibits the complexification as a sub-Hodge structure in the sense of
`TauCeti.Hodge.HodgeStructureOn.IsSubstructure`, and the induced conjugation, filtration and
components are read off from that general construction.

The definition and its base-change interface are those specified in Layer L1 of
`TauCetiRoadmap/HodgeStructures/README.md`, following Voisin, *Hodge Theory and Complex Algebraic
Geometry I*, §7.1.2. The induced structure is what makes a rational Hodge substructure a subobject
of a Hodge structure, as the semisimplicity milestone of that layer requires.

The signatures of `RationalHodgeSubstructure` and `RationalHodgeSubstructure.WC` are adapted from
the roadmap's formal companion
[`HodgeStructures/Suggested.lean`](https://github.com/TauCetiProject/TauCetiRoadmap/blob/main/HodgeStructures/Suggested.lean).

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.Hodge.RationalHodgeSubstructure`: a rational subspace split by the Hodge components.
* `TauCeti.Hodge.RationalHodgeSubstructure.isSubstructure`: its complexification is a sub-Hodge
  structure of the ambient pure Hodge structure, so
  `TauCeti.Hodge.HodgeStructureOn.IsSubstructure.hodgeStructure` equips it with the induced pure
  Hodge structure, whose Hodge components are the intersections with the ambient ones.
* `TauCeti.Hodge.RationalHodgeSubstructure.ofIsSubstructure`: conversely, a rational subspace whose
  complexification is a sub-Hodge structure is a rational Hodge substructure.
* `TauCeti.Hodge.RationalHodgeSubstructure.ofRationalMorphismRange` and
  `…ofRationalMorphismKer`: the image and kernel of a rational linear map whose complexification is
  a morphism of pure Hodge structures, as rational Hodge substructures.
* The `Lattice`, `BoundedOrder` and `IsModularLattice` instances: rational Hodge substructures
  form a modular lattice under inclusion.
* `TauCeti.Hodge.RationalHodgeSubstructure.exists_isAtom_le`: over a finite-dimensional rational
  space that lattice is atomic, its atoms being the simple substructures.

/-! ### The lattice of rational Hodge substructures

Rational Hodge substructures are ordered by inclusion of their rational subspaces, and the
intersection and the sum of two of them are again rational Hodge substructures. The resulting
lattice is modular, being a sublattice of the lattice of rational subspaces, and it satisfies the
descending chain condition as soon as the ambient rational space is finite-dimensional; so every
nonzero rational Hodge substructure contains a simple one, an atom of this lattice. -/
