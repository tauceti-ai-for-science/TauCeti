# Maps and homeomorphisms between standard simplices

An equivalence of vertex types induces `Equiv.stdSimplexHomeomorph`, preserving
barycentric weights under reindexing. No finiteness assumption on the vertex types is needed.

An affine map `Convexity.StdSimplex.affineMapMk v` out of a standard simplex is determined by the
images `v m` of the vertices. When the target is a standard simplex on a finite type, its
weights are the bilinear expressions `∑ m, w.weights m * (v m).weights n`, so the map is
continuous; `Convexity.StdSimplex.continuousAffineMapMk` bundles it as a continuous map. This
makes affine simplices, such as the simplices of a barycentric subdivision,
available as continuous maps between topological standard simplices.
