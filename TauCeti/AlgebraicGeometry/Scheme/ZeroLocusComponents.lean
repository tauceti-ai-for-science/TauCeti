# Irreducible components of the zero locus of a global function

Let `X` be an integral locally Noetherian scheme and `a` a nonzero global function on `X`. This
file identifies the irreducible components of the closed subset `V(a)` where `a` vanishes: their
generic points, which are the points of `V(a)` maximal for the specialization order among the
points of `V(a)`, are exactly the codimension-one points of `X` lying in `V(a)`. This is Krull's
principal ideal theorem read on the scheme: at a generic point `x` of a component of `V(a)`, the
maximal ideal of the local ring `𝒪_{X, x}` is a minimal prime over the germ of `a`, so it has
height at most one, and it has height at least one because `a` is a unit at the generic point of
`X`, which therefore does not lie in `V(a)`.

The points of the spectrum of the local ring `𝒪_{X, x}` are the generizations of `x`, and the
germ of `a` lies in the prime corresponding to a generization `y` exactly when `a` vanishes at
`y`; this is `TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.fromSpecStalk_mem_basicOpen_iff`, which is what
turns maximality of `x` in `V(a)` into minimality of the maximal ideal over the germ of `a`.

Conversely a codimension-one point of `V(a)` is maximal there, since its only proper generization
is the generic point of `X`. Every point of `V(a)` specializes from such a maximal point, because
coheights in a locally Noetherian scheme are finite and a generization inside `V(a)` of least
coheight is maximal.

The application is to the special fibre of a scheme over a discrete valuation ring: the special
fibre is the zero locus of a uniformizer, so its irreducible components are the codimension-one
points of the total space at which the uniformizer vanishes.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.fromSpecStalk_mem_basicOpen_iff`: a point of the spectrum of
  a local ring of `X` lies in the basic open of a section exactly when the germ of that section
  is outside the corresponding prime ideal;
* `TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.germ_mem_maximalIdeal_of_mem_zeroLocus` and
  `TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.maximalIdeal_mem_minimalPrimes_of_maximal`: at a point of the
  zero locus of a global function the germ of the function lies in the maximal ideal of the local
  ring, and at a maximal point of the zero locus the maximal ideal is a minimal prime over the germ;
* `TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.coheight_lt_top`: coheights are finite on a locally
  Noetherian scheme;
* `TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.genericPoint_notMem_zeroLocus`: a nonzero global function on
  an integral scheme does not vanish at the generic point;
* `TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.coheight_eq_one_of_maximal_mem_zeroLocus`: a maximal point
  of the zero locus of a nonzero global function has coheight one;
* `TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.maximal_mem_zeroLocus_iff`: the maximal points of that zero
  locus are exactly its codimension-one points;
* `TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.exists_maximal_mem_zeroLocus_specializes`: every point of
  the zero locus specializes from a maximal point of it.
