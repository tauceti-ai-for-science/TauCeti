# Closed subgroup schemes

This file defines closed subgroup schemes of a group scheme over an arbitrary base scheme. A
closed subgroup scheme is a categorical subobject whose representative arrow is a closed
immersion on underlying schemes. Pulling the closed-immersion property back through the two
forgetful functors makes the condition independent of the chosen representative.

Neither the base nor the group scheme is required to be affine. Affineness enters only in
specialized constructions that import this generic API.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.closedSubgroupMorphismProperty`: the closed-immersion property for morphisms of group
  schemes.
* `TauCeti.ClosedSubgroupScheme`: closed subgroup subobjects of a group scheme.
* `TauCeti.ClosedSubgroupScheme.mk`: the closed subgroup represented by a closed immersion.
* `TauCeti.ClosedSubgroupScheme.mkIso`: the canonical isomorphism of that closed subgroup with the
  source of the immersion.
