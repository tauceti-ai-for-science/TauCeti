# The adic spectrum is unchanged by completion

For a Huber ring `A` with a compatible uniform structure and any subring `A⁺ ⊆ A`, pullback along
the completion map `ι : A → Â` is a homeomorphism

```text
Spa (Â, Â⁺) ≃ₜ Spa (A, A⁺),
```

where `Â⁺ = TauCeti.Huber.completionPlus A⁺` is the closure in `Â` of the image of `A⁺`.

This is Wedhorn, *Adic Spaces* (arXiv:1910.05934v1), **Proposition 7.48**. The two halves are
already available and this file only assembles them: pullback along a dense map is inducing
(`isInducing_spaComap_of_denseRange`), and pullback along the completion map is surjective
(`spaComap_coeRingHom_surjective`). Since `spa A⁺` is T0, inducing upgrades to an embedding, and
an embedding onto everything is a homeomorphism.

The statement here is more general than Wedhorn's, which is for an affinoid ring: no Huber,
Hausdorff or completeness hypothesis is imposed on `A⁺`, and `A⁺` need not be a ring of integral
elements. Lemma 7.47 enters only as the justification for taking `Â⁺` to be the closure of the
image — when `A⁺` is a ring of integral elements, so is `Â⁺`, by
`TauCeti.Huber.IsRingOfIntegralElements.completion`.

Wedhorn's Proposition 7.48 also asserts that the homeomorphism matches rational subsets. That
clause is proved in `TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.AdicSpace.Spa.Completion.RationalSubset`. One
direction is available for any dense map, as
`exists_mem_spaRationalFamily_spaComap_preimage_eq_of_denseRange`; the other rests on
`TauCeti.Huber.isOpen_map_coeRingHom`, that the image of an open ideal of `A` generates an open
ideal of `Â`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.ValuationSpectrum.spaCompletionHomeomorph`: the adic spectrum is unchanged by
  completion.
* `TauCeti.ValuationSpectrum.spaCompletionHomeomorph_apply` and
  `TauCeti.ValuationSpectrum.coe_spaCompletionHomeomorph`: the homeomorphism is pullback along
  the completion map, pointwise and as an equality of functions.
