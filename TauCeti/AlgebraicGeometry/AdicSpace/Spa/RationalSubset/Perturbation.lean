# Rational subsets do not move under small perturbations

**A strengthening of Wedhorn, *Adic Spaces* (arXiv:1910.05934v1), Proposition 7.34.** Wedhorn
assumes a complete Hausdorff affinoid ring; the results here need only a Huber ring `A`. Fix a pair
of definition `(A₀, I)`, a ring of integral elements `A⁺`, a finite numerator set `T` whose ideal
`T · A` is open, and a denominator `s`. There is a basic neighbourhood `Iⁿ` of zero such that
replacing each numerator and the denominator by anything within `Iⁿ` of it leaves the rational
subset unchanged:

```text
R(T'/s') = R(T/s).
```

The perturbed data are not indexed by `T`: `T'` is any finite set each of whose elements is
`Iⁿ`-close to some element of `T` and which has an `Iⁿ`-close element for each of them. That is
what the statement actually needs, and it avoids carrying a bijection `T ≃ T'` — the same set may
be presented with different cardinality after perturbation.

The same estimate settles a second way of leaving a rational subset where it is: *enlarging* the
numerator set by elements too small to matter. Along a continuous homomorphism `φ : A → B` of
Huber rings, a rational subset `R(T/s)` of `Spa(B, B⁺)` with `T · B` open admits a finite `D ⊆ A`
spanning an open ideal of `A` whose image may be adjoined to `T` for free.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.ValuationSpectrum.valuation_lt_of_mem_idealImage` : elements of a sufficiently small
  basic neighbourhood have value strictly below the rational subset's denominator.
* `TauCeti.ValuationSpectrum.exists_forall_rationalSubset_eq_of_sub_mem_idealImage` : Proposition
  7.34, with the perturbation measured by an explicit power of the ideal of definition.
* `TauCeti.ValuationSpectrum.exists_mem_nhds_forall_rationalSubset_eq_of_sub_mem` : the same
  statement over a Huber ring, with the perturbation measured by a neighbourhood of zero and no
  pair of definition in sight.
* `TauCeti.ValuationSpectrum.exists_isOpen_span_rationalSubset_union_image_eq` : a rational subset
  is unchanged by adjoining the image of a suitable finite set spanning an open ideal of the
  source of a continuous homomorphism.

/-- **A neighbourhood of zero is strictly dominated by the denominator of a rational subset.**
If the numerator ideal `T · A` supplies the decomposition of
`TauCeti.Huber.PairOfDefinition.exists_forall_mem_idealImage_exists_sum_eq` in degree `n`, then
at a continuous point at which every `t ∈ T` is dominated by a nonzero `v s`, every element of
`Iⁿ` has value strictly below `v s`.

The hypothesis is the decomposition itself rather than the openness of `T · A`, because
`TauCeti.ValuationSpectrum.exists_forall_rationalSubset_eq_of_sub_mem_idealImage` applies the
estimate with two different denominators and one fixed exponent. -/

variable [IsTopologicalRing A]

/-- **A strengthening of Wedhorn Proposition 7.34.** Wedhorn assumes a complete Hausdorff
affinoid ring; here, for a numerator set `T` in a Huber ring with `T · A` open, there is an
exponent `n` such that perturbing the numerators and the denominator inside the basic
neighbourhood `Iⁿ` of zero does not change the rational subset.

The two matching hypotheses say that `T'` and `T` are `Iⁿ`-close as *sets*: every perturbed
numerator is near an original one and conversely. No hypothesis is placed on `T' · A`, and `A` is
not assumed complete. -/

/-- **A generalization of Wedhorn Proposition 7.34.** The source assumes a complete Hausdorff
affinoid ring; this theorem shows that, already over a Huber ring, a rational subset with open
numerator ideal is unchanged by perturbing its defining data inside a suitable neighbourhood of
zero.

This is the form the later theory uses: no pair of definition appears, so the neighbourhood is
the only datum a caller has to produce. -/

/-- **A rational subset absorbs the image of a small enough open-spanning finite set.** Along a
continuous homomorphism `φ : A → B` of Huber rings, a rational subset `R(T/s)` of `Spa(B, B⁺)`
whose numerator ideal `T · B` is open admits a finite `D ⊆ A` spanning an open ideal of `A` whose
image may be adjoined to the numerators for free:

```text
R((T ∪ φ(D))/s) = R(T/s).
```

Wedhorn carries out this enlargement inside the proof of Proposition 8.2(2). Neither ring is
assumed Tate, complete or Noetherian, and nothing is assumed relating the ideals of definition
of `A` and `B`: the ideal `D · A` is open for reasons internal to `A`. -/
