# The open unit disc as an adic space

The open unit disc over a complete nonarchimedean Tate field is the open subspace of the closed
unit disc exhausted by the rational subsets

```text
|T|^(n+1) ≤ |c| ≠ 0.
```

Here `c` is a pseudouniformiser.  Restricting the presentation-limit structure of the closed disc
to this open union gives the open unit disc as an adic space.  Each member of the exhaustion is an
open affinoid subspace, with the rational-localisation coordinate ring attached to the
presentation `R({T^(n+1), c}/c)`.

The open unit disc is nevertheless not affinoid. The underlying space of an affinoid pre-adic
space is spectral, hence quasi-compact, whereas Gauss points of radius close to one escape every
member of the exhaustion, so the open unit disc is not quasi-compact.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.ValuationSpectrum.discExhaustionOpen`: the rational exhaustion members as opens of
  the closed-disc pre-adic space.
* `TauCeti.ValuationSpectrum.openUnitDiscPreAdicSpace`: the restriction of the closed disc to
  their union.
* `TauCeti.ValuationSpectrum.openUnitDiscAdicSpace`: the resulting object of the category of
  adic spaces.
* `TauCeti.ValuationSpectrum.discExhaustionOpenIso`: the restriction of the closed disc to an
  exhaustion member is the presentation-limit pre-adic space of the completed rational
  localisation for `R({T^(n+1), c}/c)`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.ValuationSpectrum.coe_discExhaustionOpen`,
  `TauCeti.ValuationSpectrum.coe_openUnitDiscOpen`: on points of the closed unit disc, the
  exhaustion opens and their union are `discExhaustion c n` and `discExhaustionUnion c`.
* `TauCeti.ValuationSpectrum.discExhaustionOpen_mem_affinoidOpens`: every exhaustion member is
  an open affinoid subspace.
* `TauCeti.ValuationSpectrum.isAdic_openUnitDiscPreAdicSpace`: the open unit disc is an adic
  space.
* `TauCeti.ValuationSpectrum.noncompactSpace_openUnitDiscPreAdicSpace`: the underlying space of
  the open unit disc is not quasi-compact.
* `TauCeti.ValuationSpectrum.not_isAffinoid_openUnitDiscPreAdicSpace`: the open unit disc is not
  affinoid.
