# Relative effective Cartier divisors of degree one are sections

Let `f : X ⟶ S` be locally of finite presentation with fibres of dimension at most one, and let
`D` be a relative effective Cartier divisor on `X` over `S` which is proper over `S`. Then `D` is
finite locally free over `S`, and it maps isomorphically to `S` exactly when its degree, the rank
of `D ⟶ S`, is `1` at every point of `S`. When `f` is moreover separated, `D` is then the divisor
`[s]` of a unique section `s` of `f`, the section
`AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.IdealSheafData.sectionOfIsIso` cut out by `D`. Conversely, the divisor
of a section of a separated `f` has degree one.

Applied to the base changes `X_T = T ×_S X ⟶ T` of a proper `f`, this shows that a relative
effective Cartier divisor on `X_T` over `T` has degree one exactly when it is the graph `Γₓ` of a
`T`-point `x` of `X` over `S`, and `x` is then unique
(`TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.exists_ker_graphSection_eq_iff_finrank_eq_one`).
When `f` is smooth of relative dimension one, every graph is a relative effective Cartier divisor,
and this is the statement that the graph divisor `TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.graphDivisor` is
injective, by `TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.graphDivisor_app_injective`, with image the divisors of
degree one. Since `graphDivisor` is a natural transformation, the correspondence between points
and divisors of degree one commutes with arbitrary base change `T' ⟶ T`.

## Main results

In the namespace `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.IdealSheafData`:

* `IsRelativeEffectiveCartier.isIso_subschemeι_comp_iff_finrank_eq_one`: a proper relative
  effective Cartier divisor on a relative curve maps isomorphically to the base exactly when it
  has degree one;
* `IsRelativeEffectiveCartier.exists_comp_eq_id_and_ker_eq_iff_finrank_eq_one`: it is the
  divisor of a section exactly when it has degree one.

In the namespace `TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry`:

* `exists_ker_graphSection_eq_iff_finrank_eq_one`: a relative effective Cartier divisor on `X_T`
  over `T` is the graph of a `T`-point of `X` over `S` exactly when it has degree one.

/-- **A relative effective Cartier divisor maps isomorphically to the base exactly when it has
degree one.** If `f : X ⟶ S` is locally of finite presentation with fibres of dimension at most
one, then the closed subscheme of a relative effective Cartier divisor on `X` over `S` which is
proper over `S` maps isomorphically to `S` if and only if its rank is `1` at every point of `S`. -/
