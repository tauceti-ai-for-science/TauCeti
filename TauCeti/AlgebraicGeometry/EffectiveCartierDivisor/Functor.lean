# The functor of relative effective Cartier divisors

Let `f : X ⟶ S` be a morphism of schemes. For a scheme `T` over `S`, write `X_T = T ×_S X` for
the base change of `X`, viewed over `T` through the first projection. A morphism `T' ⟶ T` over
`S` induces `X_{T'} ⟶ X_T`, and pulling back ideal sheaves along it makes
`T ↦ {ideal sheaves on X_T}` a functor `(Over S)ᵒᵖ ⥤ Type`. The relative effective Cartier
divisors on `X_T` over `T` form a subfunctor: since the square formed by `X_{T'} ⟶ X_T` and the
two projections is a pullback square, pullback along `X_{T'} ⟶ X_T` preserves relative effective
Cartier divisors (`Scheme.IdealSheafData.IsRelativeEffectiveCartier.comap_of_isPullback`), with
no flatness assumption on `T' ⟶ T` or on `f`.

This is the functor `Div_{X/S}` of relative effective Cartier divisors. For a smooth proper curve
over a field, its subfunctor of divisors of degree `d` is the functor represented by the
symmetric power `Symᵈ X`, and `D ↦ 𝒪(D)` defines the Abel maps from it to the Picard functor;
neither the degree, the representability nor the Abel maps are treated here. The empty divisor
is a relative effective Cartier divisor on every base change, so the functor has a distinguished
point.

The base change `X_T = T ×_S X` and the induced morphisms `((Over.pullback f).map φ).left` are
those used by `TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.rigidifiedPicardFunctor`.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.relativeEffectiveCartierSubfunctor`: the subfunctor of relative
  effective Cartier divisors on `X_T` over `T` of the functor
  `TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.baseChangeIdealSheafFunctor` of ideal sheaves on base changes
  (from `TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.IdealSheaf.Functor`), whose `Subfunctor.toFunctor` is
  `Div_{X/S}`;
* `TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.top_mem_relativeEffectiveCartierSubfunctor_obj`: the empty divisor.
