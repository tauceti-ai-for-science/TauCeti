# Graphs of points as relative effective Cartier divisors

Let `f : X ⟶ S` be a separated morphism of schemes. A `T`-point `x : T ⟶ X` of `X` over `S` has a
graph `Γₓ : T ⟶ X_T = T ×_S X` (`TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.graphSection`), a section of the
projection `X_T ⟶ T` and hence a closed immersion. Its ideal sheaf commutes with base change along
morphisms `T' ⟶ T` over `S`. When `f` is moreover smooth of relative dimension one, the graph is a
relative effective Cartier divisor on `X_T` over `T`
(`Scheme.Hom.isRelativeEffectiveCartier_ker_of_smoothOfRelativeDimension`).

Together these make the graph a natural transformation `graphDivisor` from the functor of points
`T ↦ Hom_S(T, X)` of `X` to the functor `Div_{X/S}` of relative effective Cartier divisors. It is
injective at every `T`, since a point is determined by its graph, and a section of a separated
morphism by its ideal sheaf.
Composed with the Abel map `D ↦ 𝒪(D)` it gives the degree-one Abel map `x ↦ 𝒪(Γₓ)` into the
relative Picard presheaf, from which `TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.abelJacobiMap` is built.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.ker_graphSection_comp`: the ideal sheaf of the graph commutes with
  base change;
* `TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.ker_graphSection_inj`: a point is determined by the ideal sheaf of
  its graph;
* `TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.graphDivisor`: the natural transformation `Hom_S(-, X) ⟶ Div_{X/S}`
  sending a point to its graph;
* `TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.graphDivisor_app_injective`: distinct points have distinct graph
  divisors.
