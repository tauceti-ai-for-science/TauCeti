# Minimal numerical types of genus one

This file describes the minimal numerical types of genus one, the numerical shadows of the
special fibres of minimal regular models of genus-one curves.

A numerical type with a single component `i` has genus `1 + mᵢwᵢ(gᵢ - 1)`, so it has genus one
exactly when `gᵢ = 1`. With more than one component, the signed genus is `1 + ∑ᵢ Φᵢ` with every
contribution `Φᵢ` of a minimal type nonnegative and zero exactly at the `(-2)`-indices; hence a
numerical type with more than one component is minimal of genus one exactly when every component
is a `(-2)`-index.

For such a type the intersection graph is either a tree or a single cycle. More generally, suppose
only that every component satisfies `aᵢᵢ ≥ -2wᵢ` and that the intersection graph is not a tree,
that is, has positive topological genus. For every component `i` of a cycle `C` in the graph,
the two neighbours of `i` along `C` each meet `i` with `aᵢⱼ ≥ wᵢ`, so the row sums
`∑_{j ∈ C} aᵢⱼ` of the all-ones vector on `C` are nonnegative. Since the intersection form is
negative definite on proper subsets of the components and vanishes only on the multiples of the
multiplicity vector, the cycle passes through every component, all multiplicities are equal,
every component satisfies `aᵢᵢ = -2wᵢ` and meets exactly two others, each with `aᵢⱼ = wᵢ`, and
consequently all weights are equal; the topological genus is then one. The intersection matrix is
`-w` times the Cartan matrix of the affine Dynkin diagram `Ã_{n-1}`, and for a minimal type of
genus one, where moreover every `gᵢ` vanishes, this is the numerical type `I_n` of a cycle of
rational curves.

With two or three components the minimal types of genus one are listed explicitly, as the types
(2) to (9) of [Stacks, Lemma 55.6.2](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/0C8T). Write
`aᵢⱼ = wᵢα = wⱼβ` for two components that meet. Dividing the fibre relation `∑ⱼ aᵢⱼmⱼ = 0` at a
`(-2)`-index `i` by `wᵢ` turns it into a linear relation between the multiplicities with these
quotients as coefficients. With two components `i` and `j` the two relations force `αβ = 4`. With
three components forming a chain `i - j - k` they force `αβ + γδ = 4`, where `aⱼₖ = wⱼγ = wₖδ`.
The few positive integer solutions of these equations are the listed types. Three components that
pairwise meet form a cycle, to which the description above applies.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.NumericalType.arithmeticGenus_eq_one_iff_of_card_eq_one`: a numerical type with one
  component `i` has genus one exactly when `gᵢ = 1`.
* `TauCeti.NumericalType.isMinimal_and_arithmeticGenus_eq_one_iff`: with more than one
  component, a numerical type is minimal of genus one exactly when every component is a
  `(-2)`-index.
* `TauCeti.NumericalType.multiplicity_eq_of_topologicalGenus_pos`,
  `TauCeti.NumericalType.weight_eq_of_topologicalGenus_pos`,
  `TauCeti.NumericalType.intersection_self_eq_of_topologicalGenus_pos`,
  `TauCeti.NumericalType.intersection_eq_weight_of_topologicalGenus_pos` and
  `TauCeti.NumericalType.ncard_neighborSet_eq_two_of_topologicalGenus_pos`: if `aᵢᵢ ≥ -2wᵢ` for
  every component and the intersection graph is not a tree, then the intersection graph is a
  single cycle through all components, with constant multiplicities and weights, as described
  above.
* `TauCeti.NumericalType.topologicalGenus_le_one`: if `aᵢᵢ ≥ -2wᵢ` for every component, the
  topological genus is at most one.
* `TauCeti.NumericalType.isMinimal_and_arithmeticGenus_eq_one_iff_of_card_eq_two` and
  `TauCeti.NumericalType.isMinimal_and_arithmeticGenus_eq_one_iff_of_card_eq_three`: the minimal
  numerical types of genus one with two and with three components.
* `TauCeti.NumericalType.IsGenusOnePairShape` and `TauCeti.NumericalType.IsGenusOneChainShape`:
  the shapes of the minimal numerical types of genus one with two components, and with three
  components forming a chain.
* `TauCeti.NumericalType.exists_weight_multiplicity_intersection_eq_of_card_eq_two` and
  `TauCeti.NumericalType.exists_weight_multiplicity_intersection_eq_of_card_eq_three`: the shapes
  of a numerical type with two components, or with three components forming a chain, all of
  self-intersection `-2w`.
