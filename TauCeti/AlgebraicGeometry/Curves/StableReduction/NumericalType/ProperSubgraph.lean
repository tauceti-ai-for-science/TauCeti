# Proper subgraphs of `(-2)`-indices in a numerical type

A `(-2)`-index of a numerical type is a component `i` with `gᵢ = 0` and `aᵢᵢ = -2wᵢ`. The
connected configurations of `(-2)`-indices that can occur as proper subsets of the components
of a numerical type form a short explicit list, of Dynkin-diagram shape
([Stacks, Section 0C7L](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/0C7L)). This classification is
what bounds the multiplicities along chains of `(-2)`-indices in a minimal numerical type, and
hence its Picard group.

This file classifies the configurations on two, three, four, and five components. If a numerical
type has
more than two components and two `(-2)`-indices `i` and `j` meet, then up to swapping `i` and `j`,

`(wᵢ, wⱼ, aᵢⱼ) = (w, w, w)`, `(w, 2w, 2w)` or `(w, 3w, 3w)`

for some positive integer `w` ([Stacks, Tag 0C7M](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/0C7M)). If
a numerical type has more than three components and two distinct `(-2)`-indices `i` and `k` both
meet a `(-2)`-index `j`, then `i` and `k` do not meet, so that the configuration is a chain, and
up to reversing it

`(wᵢ, wⱼ, wₖ, aᵢⱼ, aⱼₖ) = (w, w, w, w, w)`, `(w, w, 2w, w, 2w)` or `(2w, 2w, w, 2w, 2w)`

([Stacks, Tag 0C7R](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/0C7R)).

On four components, a chain has four possible unoriented weight patterns, and a component meeting
three others has the simply-laced star pattern. In both cases all intersections not displayed in
the graph vanish ([Stacks, Tags 0C7V and 0C80](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/0C7V)).

On five components a chain has only three unoriented weight patterns: all five weights equal, or
four equal weights together with, at one end of the chain, their double or their half
([Stacks, Tag 0C82](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/0C82)). In particular a double edge can
occur only at an end, so the two middle edges are simply laced, and again no intersection outside
the chain is nonzero: five `(-2)`-indices never form a pentagon. Likewise, a component meeting
three other `(-2)`-indices cannot meet a fourth one
([Stacks, Lemma 55.5.6](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/0C86)).

The remaining five-component tree has a chain of length three ending in a fork. All five weights
and all four displayed intersections are equal, and every other intersection vanishes
([Stacks, Lemma 55.5.7](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/0C87)).

On six components, a chain again has equal weights and simple edges except possibly at one end,
where the endpoint may have twice or half the common interior weight. This is the base case for
the arbitrary-length chain classification of
[Stacks, Lemma 55.5.8](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/0C89).

These arguments use only the self-intersections `aᵢᵢ = -2wᵢ`, not the genera. For a pair, negative
definiteness of the principal `2 × 2` submatrix gives `aᵢⱼ² < 4wᵢwⱼ`, and `lcm(wᵢ, wⱼ) ∣ aᵢⱼ`
leaves only the three solutions above. For a triple, negative definiteness of the principal
`3 × 3` submatrix says that

`p₁q₁ + p₂q₂ + p₃q₃ + q₁q₂p₃ < 4`

where `aᵢⱼ = wᵢp₁ = wⱼq₁`, `aⱼₖ = wⱼp₂ = wₖq₂` and `aᵢₖ = wᵢp₃ = wₖq₃` are the factorisations
supplied by the divisibility axiom. All four summands are nonnegative integers and the first two
are positive, so the last two vanish; in particular `aᵢₖ = 0` and `p₁q₁ + p₂q₂ ≤ 3`. The constraints
`aᵢⱼ mⱼ ≤ 2wᵢ mᵢ` and `aᵢⱼ mᵢ ≤ 2wⱼ mⱼ` on the multiplicities listed alongside the Stacks
statements are instances of `TauCeti.NumericalType.multiplicity_mul_intersection_le`.

Beyond four components the principal determinants become unwieldy, and the five-component
classification instead evaluates the intersection form at an explicit positive integral vector.
Each ratio pattern excluded there is the diagram of an affine generalized Cartan matrix, so the
form vanishes at the vector spanning its kernel; this is what negative definiteness of the
intersection form on the vectors supported on a proper subset of the components forbids.

/-- For five components in a chain, all of self-intersection `-2w`, the four normalized adjacent
intersection ratios are `(1, 1, 1, 1)`, `(1, 1, 1, 2)` or `(2, 1, 1, 1)`: a double edge occurs
only at one of the two ends of the chain, and a triple edge not at all. The factors in the
statement express `aᵢⱼ²/(wᵢwⱼ)` without division, and together with the divisibility of each row
by its weight they give the weight patterns of
[Stacks, Lemma 55.5.5](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/0C82): all five weights equal, or
four equal weights together with, at one end, their double or their half.

The two windows of four consecutive components leave three further ratio patterns, carrying a
double edge in the middle of the chain or double edges at both of its ends. Each is ruled out by
an explicit positive vector at which the intersection form vanishes, which negative definiteness
on the vectors supported on a proper subset of the components forbids. -/
