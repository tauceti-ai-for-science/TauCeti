# The topological genus of a numerical type

The intersection matrix of a numerical type determines a finite simple graph: its vertices are
the components, and two distinct vertices are joined when the corresponding components meet.  This
file records the first Betti number of that connected graph,

`g_top = 1 - #components + #edges`,

and proves the elementary graph-theoretic facts needed when comparing it with the arithmetic genus.
The graph is connected by the defining connectedness condition of a numerical type, so its
topological genus is nonnegative; it vanishes exactly when the intersection graph is a tree.

The definition uses `Nat.card` for the finite edge type.  This avoids making the combinatorial
invariant depend on a chosen finite-type instance for the unordered pairs of components.

The terminology is that of the Stacks Project, Section 55.3, especially Lemma 55.3.10.  The
result here supplies the graph-theoretic input for the comparison with arithmetic genus in Lemma
55.3.14.
