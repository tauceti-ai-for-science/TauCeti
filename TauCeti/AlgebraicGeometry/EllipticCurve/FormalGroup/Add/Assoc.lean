# The chord group law over the fraction field of the series ring

**Associativity of the chord addition series**, `F(F(t₁, t₂), t₃) = F(t₁, F(t₂, t₃))`, proved by
transporting the honest group law of a Weierstrass curve. The parameters are power series, so the
curve has to be read over a field containing them: this file base changes `W` along
`O → MvPowerSeries σ O → KK`, records the `w`-equation there, and identifies a parameter with the
point `(q, w(q))` it names. Chord addition of those points *is* the addition series, so
associativity of the curve's group law is associativity of the series.

That argument needs a domain, so it runs over the universal curve, whose base `ℤ[A₁, ⋯, A₆]`
supplies one; `map_specialize` carries the conclusion to every `W` over every commutative ring.

## Main statements

* `WeierstrassCurve.formalAdd_assoc` : **the associativity of the addition series**, for every
  Weierstrass curve over every commutative ring. It is this module's only exported result; the
  fraction-field base change, the parametrized point `θ` and the chord additions it satisfies are
  private implementation details of its proof.

## Provenance

Adapted from Michael Stoll's `EllipticCurves` project
(`github.com/MichaelStollBayreuth/EllipticCurves`, Apache-2.0) at commit
`66889eada51a74c2f5dfb7fb5909b0b5a0a2d96e`,
`EllipticCurves/WeierstrassFormalGroup/GroupLaw.lean`, sections `Domain` and `Assembly`,
declarations `subst_wSeries_ne_zero`, `fracCurve`, `rho_weierstrass`, `thetaPoint`,
`thetaPoint_add`, `thetaPoint_neg`, `thetaPoint_inj` and `pair_intercept_ne_zero_of_ne`, together
with the single-parameter helpers `single_u_mul`, `single_iota_eq`, `single_u_eq` and
`single_wIota` from `EllipticCurves/WeierstrassFormalGroup/ThirdPoint.lean`.

Two of those are proved differently here, because this repository already has the content in a
more usable form. `pair_intercept_ne_zero_of_ne` collapses the cross combination with the single
rewrite `subst_pair_formalIntercept_mul_sub` where the source combines its two intercept readings
by hand; and Stoll's `hA` step inside `thetaPoint_add` argues through the constant coefficient,
whereas `subst_pair_thirdRootDenom_mul` already exhibits an explicit inverse. The four
single-parameter helpers are likewise transports of the `FormalGroup/Inverse.lean` identities
along `PowerSeries.subst q`, not re-derivations of them.

The source's `wSeries` and `vSeries` are `formalW` and `formalU` here, continuing the renaming
this repository applies to that development, so `subst_wSeries_ne_zero` is
`subst_formalW_ne_zero`.

The `Universal` section of the same file (declarations `universal_Δ_ne_zero` and
`assoc_addSeries_universal`) is `fracCurve_universal_Δ_ne_zero` and `assoc_formalAdd_universal`
here. Four of that section's nine declarations are not ported, because this repository already
has them: `universal`, `exists_map_universal` and `universal_Δ_ne_zero` are `Universal.curve`,
`map_specialize` and `Universal.curve_Δ_ne_zero`, and the source's `X_ne_X` and `X_ne_zero'` are
Mathlib's `MvPowerSeries.X_inj` and `nonZeroDivisors.ne_zero MvPowerSeries.X_mem_nonZeroDivisors`.

The source's `interceptSeries_ne_zero` and `X_pair_intercept_ne_zero` have no counterpart. The
source needs them only because it supplies the nonvanishing intercept two different ways, an
elementary one at a pair of distinct variables and `pair_intercept_ne_zero_of_ne` elsewhere; here
`pair_intercept_ne_zero_of_ne` covers the variable pairs too, so `thetaPoint_add_of_ne` serves
all four chord additions of the assembly.

The assembly also runs two specializations of the three parameters where the source runs one.
The source separates the middle parameter from the third with `X_ne_X`, a syntactic argument; the
corresponding hypothesis here is `q₂ ≠ ι(q₃)`, which no syntactic argument reaches, so `χ'` sends
the middle parameter to `X` and the other two to `0` exactly as `χ` does for the first.

The statement is adapted rather than transcribed, because this repository states the `w`-equation
differently. Stoll carries a second copy of the equation as a private `def mvWStepAt` and phrases
the fixed-point property as `subst_wSeries_fix`; here `wEquationRHS` is already stated over an
arbitrary algebra, so reading it in `KK` *is* that definition, and `subst_formalW_wEquation`
supplies the fixed-point property. Stoll's proof is `congrArg` followed by unfolding `mvWStepAt`;
the corresponding step here has to move the coefficients across the base change instead, which is
what `fracCurve` in the statement records.

/-- The curve `W` base changed to a commutative ring `KK` over the series ring
`MvPowerSeries σ O`. The parameters of the chord construction are series, so the group law they
satisfy is the group law of this curve; the group-law arguments below specialize `KK` to a fraction
field of the series ring, which is where the chord construction needs division, but the base change
itself asks only for a commutative algebra. There is no `Algebra O KK` to run
`WeierstrassCurve.baseChange` along, so this is the composite `map`, and it is Mathlib's `map_*`
lemmas that unfolding it exposes. -/
