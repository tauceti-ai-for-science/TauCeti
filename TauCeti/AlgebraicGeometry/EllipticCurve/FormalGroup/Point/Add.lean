# The parametrisation carries the group law: the chord case

`FormalGroup/Point/Basic.lean` sends a parameter `t` of an adic ideal to a point of `W⁄K`, and
`FormalGroup/PairEval.lean` gives the group law `F(t₁, t₂)` on parameters. This file joins them in
the case where the chord through the two points is not vertical: the point of the parameter
`F(t₁, t₂)` is the sum of the points of `t₁` and `t₂`.

This is one case of the additivity of `formalPoint`, not the whole of it. The doubling case
`t₁ = t₂` and the inverse case `t₂ = ι(t₁)` — the two ways the points can share an `x`-coordinate —
each need a different argument and are not treated here. A vanishing parameter is treated, by the
unit laws. Only with the two remaining cases does `formalPoint` become a homomorphism, and only
then are the parameters of an adic ideal a subgroup of the points of `W⁄K` rather than an indexed
family of them.

## The hypotheses

`t₁ * w(t₂) ≠ t₂ * w(t₁)` is the chord condition: over a field, where a nonzero parameter `t`
carries the coordinates `x = t / w(t)` and `y = -1 / w(t)`, it says the two points have distinct
`x`-coordinates, so the line through them is not vertical. It is what excludes the doubling and
inverse cases, which need a different argument and are not treated here.

Nothing further is asked of the parameters. `w` vanishes at `0`, so the chord condition already
excludes the zero parameter on either side; the sum is nonzero for the same reason, since
`formalAddEval_eq` writes it as the formal inverse of the third root,
`formalThirdRootEval_ne_zero` gives the third root's nonvanishing from the chord condition, and
`formalInverseEval_ne_zero` carries it across; and `formalAddEval_mem` supplies the membership
`formalPoint` needs of its argument, which is why the conclusion names that term rather than a
hypothesis.

`mul_formalWEval_eq_mul_formalWEval_iff` in `Point/Basic.lean` characterises the cross-product: it
holds exactly when a parameter vanishes, or the two are equal, or they are exchanged by `ι`. So
for two nonzero parameters those two exclusions already give the chord condition. A vanishing
parameter is the unit law `F(0, t) = t` or `F(t, 0) = t`. That is the second form of the theorem
below, and the one a caller can discharge without computing `w`.

## Main results

* `WeierstrassCurve.add_eq_formalPoint_formalAddEval_of_X_ne`: the point of `F(t₁, t₂)` is the
  sum of the points of `t₁` and `t₂`, for parameters whose points have distinct `x`-coordinates.
* `WeierstrassCurve.add_eq_formalPoint_formalAddEval_of_ne_of_ne_formalInverseEval`: the same
  conclusion, asked of the parameters themselves — two nonzero parameters must be distinct and not
  exchanged by `ι`, while a vanishing parameter is asked nothing, being a unit law.

## Provenance

Adapted from Michael Stoll's `EllipticCurves` project
(`github.com/MichaelStollBayreuth/EllipticCurves` @ `66889eada51a`, Apache-2.0),
`EllipticCurves/WeierstrassFormalGroup/Filtration.lean`, declarations `paramPoint_add` (the chord
case) and `formalPoint_add_of_ne` (the theorem below). The dichotomy the latter rests on is that
source's `eq_or_eq_negPoint_of_x_cond`, ported as an iff alongside `formalPoint` in
`Point/Basic.lean`.

The argument here is a transposition of this repository's own `FormalGroup/Add/Assoc.lean`, whose
private `thetaPoint_add` runs the same chord computation one level up — over a fraction field of
the power-series ring rather than at a parameter — for the associativity of `formalAdd`. The
scalar inputs come from the `Eval` and `PairEval` layers instead of that file's substitution
layer, and `formalPoint` replaces its `thetaPoint`.

/-! ### The points

`formalPoint` needs the base-changed curve to be elliptic and the structure map to be injective.
The group law on points needs decidable equality on `K`, which the two declarations that add points
supply locally by classical reasoning rather than asking it of callers. The first below adds
nothing, so it needs neither.

The argument runs in two steps: the chord construction identifies the sum with the third point of
the line, and the formal inverse identifies that point's negation with the point of `F(t₁, t₂)`. -/

/-- **The parametrisation carries the group law**, for two parameters that are not equal and not
exchanged by the formal inverse — conditions asked only of a pair that is nowhere zero.

`add_eq_formalPoint_formalAddEval_of_X_ne` asks instead that the chord through the two points be
non-vertical, a condition on the product `t₁ * w(t₂)`. For two nonzero parameters the two requests
agree, by `mul_formalWEval_eq_mul_formalWEval_iff`. The exclusions are guarded on both parameters
being nonzero because a vanishing one is a unit law and needs no exclusion at all: `t₁ = 0` and
`t₂ = 0` are both cases of this theorem, `t₁ = t₂ = 0` among them.

Tagged `@[simp]` like the sibling, whose left-hand side it shares. Both carry side conditions
`simp` cannot invent, so reaching either needs the hypotheses passed in, as `simp [*]` does; the
gain here is that they are inequalities of parameters rather than of products of `w`-values. -/
