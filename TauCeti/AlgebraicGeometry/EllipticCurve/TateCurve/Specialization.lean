# Specialization of the Tate equation

The coefficients of the Tate equation are formal power series with integer coefficients. In a
complete non-archimedean normed ring with `‖1‖ = 1`, their sums converge at every parameter of norm
less than one.
This remains true in residue characteristics `2` and `3`: the sixth coefficient is summed from
its integral coefficients, with no division in the target ring.

For a unit parameter in the open unit ball of a complete non-archimedean normed commutative ring
with `‖1‖ = 1`, these sums give a nonsingular Tate equation. Its discriminant has the same norm as
the parameter, even when the ring norm is only submultiplicative. The coefficients `a₄` and `a₆`
have norm at most that of the parameter and `c₄` has norm one, so over a field
`|j| = 1 / |q| > 1`. Point uniformisation requires further arguments.
