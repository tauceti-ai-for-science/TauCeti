# Complements on Weierstrass curves

Facts about the invariants of an elliptic curve, complementing
`Mathlib/AlgebraicGeometry/EllipticCurve/Weierstrass.lean`:

* `WeierstrassCurve.a₁_ne_zero_or_a₃_ne_zero_of_Δ_ne_zero_of_two_eq_zero`: where `2 = 0`, a curve
  with `Δ ≠ 0`
  has `a₁ ≠ 0` or `a₃ ≠ 0`;
* `WeierstrassCurve.Δ_eq_of_c₄_eq_of_c₆_eq`: two equations with the same `c`-invariants have the
  same discriminant, wherever `1728` is a regular element, by `WeierstrassCurve.c_relation`;
* `WeierstrassCurve.j_eq_1728_iff`: `j = 1728 ↔ c₆ = 0`, the analogue for `j = 1728` of Mathlib's
  `WeierstrassCurve.j_eq_zero_iff` (`j = 0 ↔ c₄ = 0`), together with its unreduced companion
  `WeierstrassCurve.j_eq_1728_iff'` mirroring `WeierstrassCurve.j_eq_zero_iff'`;
* `WeierstrassCurve.baseChange_c₄_ne_zero` and `WeierstrassCurve.baseChange_c₆_ne_zero`: the two
  corollaries of those criteria that say `j ≠ 0` and `j ≠ 1728` survive base change along an
  injection, in the `c₄`/`c₆` form the automorphism criterion consumes.
* `WeierstrassCurve.cusp`: the cusp curve `Y² = X³`, its coefficient projections, and the point
  `(1, 1)` on it (`WeierstrassCurve.equation_cusp_one_one`). It depends on nothing beyond a
  Weierstrass equation, and is the specialization target
  `TauCeti/AlgebraicGeometry/EllipticCurve/Universal.lean` uses to retract the universal ring
  onto `ℤ`.

All are stated over a commutative ring, matching the generality of the Mathlib results they
complement. The first two are consumed by the automorphism-group development in
`TauCeti/AlgebraicGeometry/EllipticCurve/Aut.lean`, the `Aut (E, O)` milestone of
`TauCetiRoadmap/EllipticCurves/README.md` §Layer 1; the base-change pair is consumed by the
twist classification in `TauCeti/AlgebraicGeometry/EllipticCurve/QuadraticTwist/Basic.lean`, which
needs `Aut(Eᴸ) = {±1}` after base change to a splitting field.

Adapted from the FLT project (`ImperialCollegeLondon/FLT`,
`FLT/Mathlib/AlgebraicGeometry/EllipticCurve/Weierstrass.lean` at the roadmap's pin
`bc2fe8ff7396` (FLT PR #1088), Apache 2.0, by Kevin Buzzard and Claude). Every result here
**except the cusp curve** is adapted from that file, and all are generalised from FLT's
field-level statements to a commutative ring: the two `j`-criteria, and the base-change pair
`baseChange_c₄_ne_zero` /
`baseChange_c₆_ne_zero`, which FLT states only for a field extension. The cusp curve is not
from FLT: it came with the universal-curve port and is placed here because it needs no universal
machinery.

/-- Where `2 = 0`, a curve with nonzero discriminant has `a₁ ≠ 0` or `a₃ ≠ 0`: otherwise

def cusp (R : Type*) [Zero R] : Affine R := { a₁ := 0, a₂ := 0, a₃ := 0, a₄ := 0, a₆ := 0 }

/-- Every coefficient of the cusp curve vanishes, and likewise for `cusp_a₂` through `cusp_a₆`.
The definition body is unexposed, so these are how a consumer projects out of `cusp` — for instance
when specialising the universal curve along it. -/

/-- The `a₃` coefficient of the cusp curve vanishes. -/
@[simp] lemma cusp_a₃ (R : Type*) [Zero R] : (cusp R).a₃ = 0 := (rfl)
/-- The `a₄` coefficient of the cusp curve vanishes. -/
@[simp] lemma cusp_a₄ (R : Type*) [Zero R] : (cusp R).a₄ = 0 := (rfl)

/-- `(1, 1)` lies on the cusp curve `Y² = X³`, over any commutative ring.

The case `R = ℤ` is the one the universal curve uses: specializing along that point is the cheap
route to nonvanishing statements, since `ψₙ(1,1) = n`, so a universal quantity that vanished would
have to vanish in `ℤ`. The `CharZero Universal.Ring` instance in
`TauCeti/AlgebraicGeometry/EllipticCurve/Universal.lean` is obtained that way. -/
