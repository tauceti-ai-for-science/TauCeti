# Semistable elliptic curves over a Dedekind domain

Let `O` be a Dedekind domain with fraction field `K`. An elliptic curve over `K` is
**semistable over `O`** when its reduction at every height-one prime is either good or
multiplicative, equivalently never additive. Reduction is a property of a minimal equation, so
the definition applies Mathlib's reduction predicates to a chosen local minimal equation.

This file proves both local characterizations of semistability. At a discrete valuation ring, a
minimal equation is not additive exactly when either its discriminant or its `c₄` has valuation
one. Globally, this criterion is imposed at every height-one prime. It also proves that the
predicate is independent of the equation presenting the curve: changing variables changes the
chosen local minimal equation, but the two minimal equations have the same discriminant and `c₄`
valuations.

Finally, semistability is preserved by base change along any extension, generalizing Silverman
VII.5.4(b), which is stated for finite extensions. Locally, no additive reduction is the same as
having *some* integral model with a unit discriminant or a unit `c₄`, not necessarily the chosen
minimal one, and such a model stays integral with that unit along any map of discrete valuation
rings compatible with the fraction fields. Globally, a height-one prime of the
larger Dedekind domain lies over a height-one prime of the smaller one, whose local ring maps to its
own, or over zero, where the curve has good reduction.

## Main definitions

* `WeierstrassCurve.IsSemistable`: an elliptic equation whose local minimal equation has no
  additive reduction at any height-one prime.

## Main results

* `WeierstrassCurve.isSemistable_iff_forall_hasGoodReduction_or_hasMultiplicativeReduction`:
  semistability is good or multiplicative reduction everywhere.
* `WeierstrassCurve.not_hasAdditiveReduction_iff_valuation_Δ_eq_one_or_valuation_c₄_eq_one`:
  the local valuation criterion on a minimal equation.
* `WeierstrassCurve.isSemistable_iff_forall_valuation_Δ_eq_one_or_valuation_c₄_eq_one`:
  the corresponding global criterion.
* `WeierstrassCurve.isSemistable_smul`: semistability is invariant under a change of variables.
* `WeierstrassCurve.isSemistable_baseChange_of_isCoprime`: an equation over `O` whose
  discriminant and `c₄` are coprime is semistable.
* `WeierstrassCurve.not_hasAdditiveReduction_minimal_iff_exists_isUnit`: no additive reduction
  means some integral model has a unit discriminant or a unit `c₄`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.not_hasAdditiveReduction_minimal_baseChange`: no additive reduction is
  preserved along a map of discrete valuation rings.
* `WeierstrassCurve.IsSemistable.baseChange`: semistability is preserved by base change along an
  extension of Dedekind domains.

/-! ### The local criterion -/

/-- A minimal equation is not additively reduced exactly when its discriminant or its `c₄` is a
unit at the place. A unit discriminant gives good reduction; a unit `c₄` gives multiplicative
reduction when the discriminant is not a unit.

This is valuation arithmetic on the equation itself, so no ellipticity is needed; `IsSemistable`
adds that hypothesis where the trichotomy is read as a reduction type. -/
