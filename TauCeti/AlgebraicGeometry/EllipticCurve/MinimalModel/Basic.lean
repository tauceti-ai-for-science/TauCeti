# Minimal models: a criterion, their comparison, and what transfers between them

Mathlib defines `WeierstrassCurve.IsMinimal` by a maximality property — the valuation of the
discriminant is maximal among all integral models isomorphic to the given one — and derives
minimality only from that property or from a class that already extends it. Establishing it for a
*given* equation therefore means quantifying over every change of variables, which is not something
a caller can discharge by hand.

This file supplies the cheapest sufficient conditions — an integral Weierstrass equation whose `c₄`
or whose discriminant is a **unit** at the place is already minimal — and then the comparison any
two minimal models admit: they have the same discriminant valuation, so a change of variables
between them has a scaling factor of valuation `1`, and they have the same `c₄` valuation too.

## Main results

* `WeierstrassCurve.isMinimal_of_valuation_c₄_eq_one`: over the fraction field of a discrete
  valuation ring, an integral Weierstrass equation with `v (c₄) = 1` is minimal.
* `WeierstrassCurve.isMinimal_of_valuation_Δ_eq_one`: so is one with `v (Δ) = 1`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.isMinimal_baseChange_of_isUnit_Δ_or_isUnit_c₄`: the same two criteria for an
  equation given over `R`, whose discriminant or `c₄` is a unit.
* `WeierstrassCurve.exists_smul_eq_minimal`: Mathlib's chosen minimal equation is obtained by a
  change of variables.
* `WeierstrassCurve.exists_smul_minimal_eq_minimal`: chosen minimal equations of isomorphic
  equations are related by a change of variables.
* `WeierstrassCurve.valuation_Δ_le_of_isMinimal_smul`: no integral model in the orbit of a minimal
  model has larger `v (Δ)`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.valuation_Δ_eq_of_isMinimal_smul`: two minimal models related by a change of
  variables have equal `v (Δ)`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.isMinimal_of_valuation_Δ_eq_of_isMinimal_smul`: conversely, an integral model
  attaining that valuation is minimal.
* `WeierstrassCurve.valuation_Δ_baseChange_smul` and
  `WeierstrassCurve.valuation_c₄_baseChange_smul`: a change of variables defined over `R` preserves
  the valuations of `Δ` and `c₄`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.isMinimal_baseChange_smul`: so it carries a minimal model to a minimal model.
* `WeierstrassCurve.reduction_baseChange_smul`: and its residue transforms the reduction.
* `WeierstrassCurve.hasMultiplicativeReduction_baseChange_smul_iff`,
  `WeierstrassCurve.hasAdditiveReduction_baseChange_smul_iff` and
  `WeierstrassCurve.hasSplitMultiplicativeReduction_baseChange_smul_iff`: the reduction types are
  invariant under it.
* `WeierstrassCurve.valuation_u_eq_one_of_isMinimal_smul`: for an elliptic curve, the scaling
  factor of such a change of variables satisfies `v (u) = 1`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.valuation_c₄_eq_of_isMinimal_smul`: hence the two minimal models have equal
  `v (c₄)`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.VariableChange.exists_unit_algebraMap_eq_u_of_isMinimal_smul`: the scaling
  factor is the image of a unit of the discrete valuation ring.
* `VariableChange.exists_baseChange_eq_and_smul_integralModel_eq_of_isMinimal_smul`: so the
  change of variables is defined over `R` and relates the two integral models.
* `WeierstrassCurve.exists_smul_reduction_eq_of_isMinimal_smul`: the reductions of two minimal
  models are related by a change of variables over the residue field.
* `WeierstrassCurve.valuation_Δ_minimal_smul` and
  `WeierstrassCurve.valuation_c₄_minimal_smul`: the chosen minimal equations of isomorphic curves
  have the same discriminant and `c₄` valuations.
* `WeierstrassCurve.hasGoodReduction_minimal_smul_iff` and
  `WeierstrassCurve.HasGoodReduction.hasGoodReduction_minimal`: good reduction of the chosen
  minimal equation is a property of the curve, and holds whenever some equation has good
  reduction.
* `WeierstrassCurve.hasGoodReduction_iff_isUnit_integralModel_Δ`: an integral equation has good
  reduction exactly when its integral discriminant is a unit, and then it is elliptic
  (`WeierstrassCurve.HasGoodReduction.isElliptic`).
* `WeierstrassCurve.HasGoodReduction.baseChange` and `WeierstrassCurve.reduction_baseChange`:
  good reduction is preserved by base change along a map of discrete valuation rings, and the
  reduction of the base change is the base change of the reduction.
* `WeierstrassCurve.HasSplitMultiplicativeReduction.of_isMinimal_smul`: split multiplicative
  reduction transfers along such a change of variables.

`valuation_u_eq_one_of_isMinimal_smul` and
`VariableChange.exists_unit_algebraMap_eq_u_of_isMinimal_smul` supply the unit needed for descent.
Turning that into a change of variables actually *defined* over `R` is the job of
`WeierstrassCurve.VariableChange.exists_baseChange_eq_of_smul_eq`, which also consumes integrality
of both models. A change of variables defined over `R` is one the reduction can see, and that is
what carries split multiplicativity across.

## Why this is the useful form

The hypothesis is stated through the adic valuation of `W.c₄ : K`, matching how Mathlib phrases
`WeierstrassCurve.HasMultiplicativeReduction`, whose `multiplicativeReduction` field is exactly
`valuation K (maximalIdeal R) W.c₄ = 1`. That class *extends* `IsMinimal`, so the implication is
not needed to go from multiplicative reduction to minimality — it is needed in the other
direction, to **construct** `HasMultiplicativeReduction` for an equation one has only computed
`c₄` and `Δ` for. That is the shape a quadratic twist arrives in: twisting by a discriminant that
is a unit scales `c₄` by a unit square, so the twist's `c₄` valuation is again `1`, and this
criterion is what turns that computation into minimality of the twisted model.

## Mathematical content

It is the unit-`c₄` case of the Kraus–Laska criterion — the special case "`v (c₄) < 4` or
`v (Δ) < 12` implies minimal" of Silverman, *The Arithmetic of Elliptic Curves*,
Remark VII.1.1, restricted to `v (c₄) = 0`. The proof is direct: a change of variables scales
`c₄` by `u⁻⁴` and `Δ` by `u⁻¹²`, and integrality of the transformed model bounds `v (u⁻⁴)` by
`1`, hence `v (u⁻¹²) ≤ 1`, so no change of variables can raise the discriminant's valuation.
The unit-`Δ` case, `isMinimal_of_valuation_Δ_eq_one`, is immediate, since every integral model
has `v (Δ) ≤ 1`.

## Provenance

⚠ *mathlib-track*: this is a statement about Mathlib's own `IsMinimal`, with no Tau Ceti
definitions involved, and belongs upstream once its consumers are in place.

The source declaration `HasSplitMultiplicativeReduction.of_isMinimal_smul` no longer exists at
FLT's current head (`9deae05a`), which drops that development entirely; the pinned revision above
is the record of it. It is absent from Mathlib too, whose `IsMinimal` API stops at the pairwise
exclusion of the reduction types and never compares two minimal models.

/-! ### Comparing two minimal models

`IsMinimal` says the discriminant valuation is maximal among integral models. Two minimal models of
the same curve therefore pin each other: each is at least as good as the other, so their
valuations agree, and the change of variables between them can only scale `Δ` by a unit. -/

/-- **A minimal model maximises the discriminant valuation in its orbit**: every integral model
obtained from it by a change of variables has discriminant of at most that valuation. This is the
`valuation`-level reading of Mathlib's `IsMinimal`, whose `MaximalFor` phrasing speaks of
`valuation_Δ_aux` and of the orbit of a fixed equation. -/

/-- **Good reduction is preserved by base change.** Let `S` be a discrete valuation ring with
fraction field `L`, receiving `R` compatibly with `K → L`. If an equation has good reduction over
`R`, then its base change to `L` has good reduction over `S`: the unit discriminant of its integral
model stays a unit. No ramification hypothesis is needed, and the base-changed equation is again
minimal (Silverman, *AEC*, VII.5.4(b)). -/

/-- **Split multiplicative reduction is an isomorphism invariant of minimal models.** If two
minimal Weierstrass models of an elliptic curve over `K` are related by a change of variables
(`D • W₁ = W₂`), and `W₁` has split multiplicative reduction, then so does `W₂`.

This is what makes split multiplicative reduction a property of the curve at the place rather than
of the equation presenting it. Mathlib's class is stated through a *chosen* integral model, so the
transfer is not definitional: it needs `D` to be defined over `R`. Two results combine to give
that — `valuation_u_eq_one_of_isMinimal_smul` supplies the unit scaling factor, and
`VariableChange.exists_baseChange_eq_of_smul_eq` turns that unit, with integrality of both models,
into the descent. A form of Silverman, *The Arithmetic of Elliptic Curves*, Remark VII.1.3(b), on
the uniqueness of minimal models over a discrete valuation ring. -/
