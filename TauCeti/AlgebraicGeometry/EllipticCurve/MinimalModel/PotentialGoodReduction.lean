# Potential good reduction

Let `R` be a discrete valuation ring with fraction field `K`. An elliptic curve over `K` has
**potential good reduction** when it acquires good reduction after a finite extension of `K`:
there are a finite extension `L / K` and a discrete valuation ring `S` with fraction field `L`
dominating `R`, such that a minimal equation of the curve over `S` has good reduction.

The minimal model is taken *after* the base change. An equation that is minimal over `R` need not
stay minimal over `S`, and Mathlib's `HasGoodReduction` holds only for minimal equations, so
asking `HasGoodReduction S (W.baseChange L)` would make the predicate depend on the chosen model
over `K`.

Over a complete `R` the valuation of `K` extends uniquely to `L` (Neukirch, *Algebraic Number
Theory*, II.4.8), so the integral closure of `R` in `L` is the only discrete valuation ring
with fraction field `L` dominating `R`; then `S` is forced and the definition is the usual one.
For a general `R` the place of `L` above `R` is part of the data being quantified over.

The main result is the necessary direction of the `j`-invariant criterion (Silverman VII.5.5):
an elliptic curve with potential good reduction has **integral** `j`-invariant. The proof reads
`j = c₄ ³ / Δ` on a minimal model with good reduction over `S`, where `Δ` is a unit, and descends
integrality from `S` to `R` because `R`, a valuation ring, is integrally closed against every ring
dominating it. In particular a curve with multiplicative reduction, whose `j`-invariant has a pole,
never has potential good reduction.

## Main definitions

* `WeierstrassCurve.HasPotentialGoodReduction`: good reduction after some finite extension.

## Main results

* `WeierstrassCurve.HasGoodReduction.hasPotentialGoodReduction`: good reduction is potentially
  good.
* `WeierstrassCurve.hasPotentialGoodReduction_smul`: potential good reduction is invariant under
  a change of variables.
* `WeierstrassCurve.HasGoodReduction.isInteger_j`: a minimal equation with good reduction has
  integral `j`-invariant.
* `WeierstrassCurve.HasPotentialGoodReduction.isInteger_j`: a curve with potential good reduction
  has integral `j`-invariant.
* `WeierstrassCurve.HasMultiplicativeReduction.not_isInteger_j` and
  `WeierstrassCurve.HasMultiplicativeReduction.not_hasPotentialGoodReduction`: multiplicative
  reduction gives a nonintegral `j`-invariant, so it is not potentially good.

/-- **Potential good reduction**: after some finite extension `L` of `K`, at some discrete
valuation ring `S` with fraction field `L` dominating `R`, a minimal equation of `W` has good
reduction. The maps `R → S → L` and `R → K → L` are required to agree, so that `S` lies over `R`.
The field `L` and the ring `S` are taken in the universe of `K`.

Over a complete `R`, the integral closure of `R` in `L` is the only such ring `S`, so this is the
usual notion of good reduction over the ring of integers of a finite extension. -/
