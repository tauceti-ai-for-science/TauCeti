# Changes of variables between integral models

A change of variables `D : VariableChange K` carrying one integral Weierstrass model to another
need not be integral itself: its scaling factor `D.u` is a unit of `K`, and `D.r`, `D.s`, `D.t` are
elements of `K`. This file shows that when `R` is integrally closed in `K`, as soon as `D.u` lies
in `R` so do `D.r`, `D.s` and `D.t`, and hence that when `D.u` comes from a unit of `R`, `D` is the
base change of a `VariableChange R`. Further facts about integral models sit beside it: over a
domain with fraction field `K` every equation has an integral model, obtained by clearing a common
denominator of the coefficients; a change of variables whose `u⁻¹`, `r`, `s` and `t` lie in `R`
preserves integrality, and one defined over `R` acts on the integral model; integrality is
inherited by a larger ring of a tower; and when `R → K` is injective the integral model is unique,
and it commutes with base change along a map `R → S` compatible with `K → L`.

## Main results

* `WeierstrassCurve.VariableChange.isInteger_r_s_t_of_smul_eq`: for `R` integrally closed in `K`,
  if `D • W₁ = W₂` with `W₁` and `W₂` integral over `R` and `D.u ∈ R`, then `D.r`, `D.s` and
  `D.t` lie in `R` (Silverman VII.1.3(d)).
* `WeierstrassCurve.VariableChange.exists_baseChange_eq_of_smul_eq`: for `R` integrally closed in
  `K` (`IsIntegrallyClosedIn R K`), if `D • W₁ = W₂` with `W₁` and `W₂` integral over `R` and `D.u`
  the image of a unit of `R`, then `D = C₀.baseChange K` for some `C₀ : VariableChange R`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.exists_smul_isIntegral`: every equation over `K` has an integral model over a
  ring `R` with fraction field `K`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.isIntegral_smul_of_exists_lift`: a change of variables whose `u⁻¹`, `r`, `s`
  and `t` lie in `R` preserves integrality.
* `WeierstrassCurve.isIntegral_baseChange_smul` and
  `WeierstrassCurve.integralModel_baseChange_smul`: a change of variables defined over `R` preserves
  integrality, and acts on the integral model.
* `WeierstrassCurve.IsIntegral.of_isScalarTower`: integrality passes to a larger ring of the
  tower.
* `WeierstrassCurve.integralModel_eq_of_baseChange_eq`: the integral model is the equation over
  `R` with the given base change.
* `WeierstrassCurve.IsIntegral.baseChange` and `WeierstrassCurve.integralModel_baseChange`:
  integrality is preserved by base change along a map `R → S` compatible with `K → L`, and the
  integral model of the base change is the image of the integral model.

The integral-closedness hypothesis is what the proof actually consumes. A discrete valuation ring
with its fraction field is the intended application and satisfies it through
`isIntegrallyClosed_iff_isIntegrallyClosedIn`, but no valuation is used anywhere below.

## How it is proved

Each of `r`, `s`, `t` is exhibited as a root of an explicit **monic** polynomial over `R`, built
from the change-of-variables formulas for the invariants, and `R` is integrally closed:

* `r` from the `b₆`- and `b₈`-relations, as a root of a quartic. The two are combined as
  `b₈-relation − r · b₆-relation`: that cancels the `r³ · b₂` terms and turns `3r⁴ − 4r⁴` into
  `−r⁴`, leaving `b₈ + 2r · b₆ + r² · b₄ − r⁴`. The `r⁴` term does not cancel and must not — it is
  the quartic's leading term;
* `s` from the `a₂`-relation, as a root of a quadratic, once `r` is known to lie in `R`;
* `t` from the `a₆`-relation, likewise a quadratic, once `r` is known.

The three arguments are separate private lemmas rather than one proof: each is a distinct
integrality certificate with its own polynomial, and taken together they are past the repository's
hard cap on proof length. `s` and `t` take the integral representative of `r` as a hypothesis,
which is why they are stated after it rather than beside it.

## Why this is not in `EllipticCurve/VariableChange.lean`

That file is where this repository keeps its `VariableChange` API, and the statement below is about
`VariableChange.baseChange`, so it would sit there naturally — except that the proof needs
`WeierstrassCurve.IsIntegral` and `integralModel`, i.e. Mathlib's `EllipticCurve.Reduction` with its
valuation machinery. `VariableChange.lean` currently imports only
`Mathlib.AlgebraicGeometry.EllipticCurve.VariableChange`, and three modules import it; putting the
descent there would push the reduction cone onto all of them. The topic here is integral models, so
the file is named for them.

## Provenance

⚠ *mathlib-track*. Statements about Mathlib's own `IsIntegral` for Weierstrass models and
`VariableChange.baseChange`, with no Tau Ceti definitions involved.

The descent is ported from FLT, https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/FLT
@ `bc2fe8ff7396469a16c2a6d51d6117f5825d93a0` (Apache-2.0), file
`FLT/Mathlib/AlgebraicGeometry/EllipticCurve/Reduction.lean`, declaration
`WeierstrassCurve.exists_variableChange_baseChange_eq_of_smul_eq`, by Kevin Buzzard;
`exists_smul_isIntegral`, `isIntegral_smul_of_exists_lift`, `IsIntegral.of_isScalarTower` and the
base-change lemmas are not from that source. The source
commit is FLT PR #1088, "Quadratic twist to split multiplicative reduction". The mathematics is
unchanged: the same three polynomials, the same `linear_combination` certificates. The single
66-line proof is split into the three integrality arguments plus their assembly, so that no
declaration exceeds the length cap. Three hypotheses are weakened relative to the source, which
states the descent for a discrete valuation ring and a unit scaling factor: the integrality
certificates need only `Algebra R K` and a scaling factor in `R`, and the assembly needs only
`IsIntegrallyClosedIn R K`.

/-! ### Assembly

Pulling the three roots back into `R` is exactly `IsIntegrallyClosedIn R K`, and that is the only
hypothesis this section adds. A discrete valuation ring together with its fraction field is the
intended way to obtain it — see `isIntegrallyClosed_iff_isIntegrallyClosedIn` — but nothing here
requires a valuation, and `K` need not be a fraction field. -/

need not be a unit: this is the case of a change of variables carrying an integral model to a
minimal one, whose scaling factor has the valuation of the obstruction to minimality. -/
