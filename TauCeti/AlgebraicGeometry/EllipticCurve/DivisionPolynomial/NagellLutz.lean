# Nagell–Lutz integrality

Over `ℤ`, a nonzero torsion point of a Weierstrass curve has integral coordinates — unless it has
order exactly two, where the honest bound is that `4x` and `8y` are integral. Over the fraction
field `K` of a general unique factorisation domain `R` the same holds **given squarefreeness of
the right factor**: `Squarefree (2 : R)` when `4` divides the order, or squarefreeness of an odd
prime divisor of it. An arbitrary squarefree factor will not do — at order `6`, `Squarefree 2`
supplies neither branch. That hypothesis is what the `ℤ` statement discharges for free, and it is
not removable in general. This file is the assembly: `Torsion/Basic.lean` proves the cases a
squarefree hypothesis makes accessible, `Descent.lean` pulls a conclusion back from a multiple of a
point to the point itself, and what remains is the case analysis that connects them.

The split is on the order `m` of the point, and `m ≠ 1`, `m ≠ 2` put it in the range where
Mathlib's `Nat.four_dvd_or_exists_odd_prime_and_dvd_of_two_lt` applies: either `4 ∣ m`, or `m` has
an odd prime factor `p`. In the first case `(m / 4) • P` is killed by `4` but not by `2` and the
order-four theorem applies; in the second `(m / p) • P` is nonzero and killed by `p`, so the
odd-index theorem does. Descent along `m / 4` resp. `m / p` returns the conclusion at `P`. The
excluded case `m = 2` **need not** be integral; there `den_dvd_four_of_order_two` bounds the
denominator of `x` instead, and `ψ₂` vanishing bounds `y`.

Squarefreeness is a hypothesis rather than a typeclass, and it is **guarded by `m ≠ 2`**. The
order-two disjunct needs none of it, and an unguarded hypothesis would be unsatisfiable *for
two-torsion points* over any `R` in which `2` ramifies — `Squarefree (2 : ℤ[i])` is false, since
`2 = -i(1 + i)²`. Points of odd order over such an `R` are unaffected, since the hypothesis only
ever concerns primes dividing that point's own order; the guard is what keeps the order-two case
usable rather than what rescues the theorem. Over `ℤ` it costs nothing, which is why the
specialisation below carries no arithmetic hypothesis at all.

## Main results

* `WeierstrassCurve.isInteger_or_order_two_of_torsion`: the statement over a UFD `R`. Its
  squarefreeness hypothesis is **guarded** by `addOrderOf P ≠ 2` and asks only for the *one branch*
  the proof consumes, not for every prime factor.
* `WeierstrassCurve.isInteger_or_order_two_of_torsion_of_squarefree`: the same conclusion from a
  *uniform* hypothesis — squarefreeness at **every** prime factor of the order. That is strictly
  stronger, and therefore not weaker to prove; it is simply the form a caller usually already has,
  because it needs no knowledge of which branch the order falls into.
* `WeierstrassCurve.isInteger_or_order_two_of_torsion_rat`: the `ℤ`/`ℚ` specialisation, assuming
  only that the point is torsion.
* `WeierstrassCurve.isInteger_four_mul_x_and_eight_mul_y_of_order_two`: the order-two bound on its
  own, from a Jacobian two-torsion hypothesis and needing no squarefreeness at all.

## Roadmap

New mathematics: `TauCetiRoadmap/EllipticCurves/README.md:821` — "**The torsion subgroup and
Nagell–Lutz**", route "division polynomials" (`:830`–`:831`). Lines `:823`–`:827` state this
theorem for an integral **long** Weierstrass model: over `ℚ`, "a nonzero torsion point has
`x, y ∈ ℤ` unless it has order exactly `2`, where the honest bound is `4x, 8y ∈ ℤ`". The
discriminant companion and the short-model form (`:828`–`:830`) are separate targets.

## Provenance

Ported from J. Xu and D. K. Angdinata's AINTLIB (`github.com/CBirkbeck/AINTLIB`, Apache-2.0,
`main @ 1c1c74664e40071c2c2165bc55ca2616a67ccd6b`), from **two** files of
`projects/NagellLutz/LutzNagell/LutzNagellTheorem/`, both byte-identical at `9fec8eba7652` — the
revision the roadmap pins for this project (`README:1072`) — verified by blob hash, so the
citations hold at either.

`PIDMain.lean` supplies the statement shape: `nsmul_eq_zero_affine_to_jac` (`:48`),
`exists_some_of_ne_zero` (`:60`), `integrality_of_odd_prime_factor` (`:83`),
`integrality_of_four_dvd_order` (`:110`) and `lutz_nagell_integrality_pid` (`:145`), which is
already stated over a general base in `IsLocalization.IsInteger` terms.

`GeneralMain.lean` supplies the order-two conclusion. Its `lutz_nagell_integrality_general`
(`:112`) ends in `4x, 8y` integral, which is the form the roadmap asks for, where the `PID`
theorem ends in the weaker denominator bound `den(x) ∣ 4`. That file states the theorem over `ℚ`
only, so `isInteger_or_order_two_of_torsion_rat` is *its* statement and
`isInteger_or_order_two_of_torsion` generalises it.

Three adaptations. The base ring is a **UFD** rather than the source's principal ideal domain of
characteristic zero, matching `Torsion/Basic.lean` — no ideal is ever formed here, and `CharZero` is
unused. The squarefreeness hypothesis is **guarded by `addOrderOf P ≠ 2`**, which the source
leaves unguarded; see the note above on why an unguarded form is unsatisfiable over a ramifying
base — for two-torsion points, that is; a point of odd order never invokes `Squarefree (2 : R)`.
And the arithmetic of the case split is **not ported at all**: both sources derive
`4 ∣ m` from "no odd prime factor" by hand, roughly a dozen lines each, but that is exactly
Mathlib's `Nat.four_dvd_or_exists_odd_prime_and_dvd_of_two_lt`, so the split is one `rcases`.

`isInteger_or_order_two_of_torsion`, but asking for squarefreeness at *every* prime factor of the
order rather than at the one branch the proof consumes.

That hypothesis is strictly stronger — only one branch is ever used — so it is not a weaker thing
to prove. It is exported because it is usually the one a caller already has: establishing it needs
no knowledge of which branch the order falls into, whereas the sharp form does. Both are exported
for that reason, bridged by `Algebra/Squarefree.lean`'s
`Nat.four_dvd_or_exists_odd_prime_and_dvd_of_squarefree`. The guard
`addOrderOf P ≠ 2` is on both: the order-two disjunct is proved without squarefreeness, and
requiring it there would make the statement vacuous over a base in which `2` ramifies. -/
