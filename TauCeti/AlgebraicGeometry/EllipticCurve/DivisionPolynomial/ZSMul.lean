# Coordinates of scalar multiplication through the division polynomials

The Nagell–Lutz route expresses `n • (X, Y)` on the universal curve through the division
polynomials: the affine `X`-coordinate is `φₙ/ψₙ²` and the `Y`-coordinate is `ωₙ/ψₙ³`, as
elements of `Universal.Field`. This file defines those two rational functions, `smulX` and
`smulY`, develops the `smulX` calculus — values at `0`, `1` and `2`, the offset `ψₙ₊₁ψₙ₋₁/ψₙ²`
from the `X`-coordinate, evenness in `n`, nonvanishing, the difference `smulX m - smulX n` as a
single quotient, and the separation statement `smulX m = smulX n ↔ m = n ∨ m = -n` — and then
**proves the identification itself**: `zsmul_point_eq_smulX_smulY` says that
`(smulX n, smulY n)`
really are the affine coordinates of `n • (X, Y)`, for every `n ≠ 0`. `smulY`'s own sign rule is
here too: negating a nonzero index negates the point, so `smulY (-n)` is the `negY` of
`(smulX n, smulY n)`.

The middle of the file turns that calculus on the pair `(smulX 1, smulY 1)`, which is the
distinguished point `(X, Y)` itself. For `n ≠ 0` the vertical gap
`smulY n - negY (smulX n) (smulY n)` is `ψ₂ₙ/ψₙ⁴`, hence nonzero, so `smulY n` never equals the
`negY` of its own pair. The quotient formula genuinely needs `n ≠ 0`, since `ψ₀ = 0` leaves it
meaningless; `smulY_ne_negY` carries the same hypothesis because it is *derived* from that formula,
not because it fails at `n = 0` — there it reads `0 ≠ -a₃`, which holds. At `n = 1` the gap
is `ψ₂`, which selects the tangent branch of Mathlib's `Affine.slope` and gives the tangent slope
`slopeOne` the closed form `-Wₓ/ψ₂`. Feeding that slope to Mathlib's affine addition formula sends
`(smulX 1, smulY 1)` to `(smulX 2, smulY 2)`: `addX … = smulX 2` and `addY … = smulY 2`. Those two
are the `n = 2` base case of the induction; `smulX_add` and `smulY_add_sub_negY`, the chord
formulas relating the values at `n + m`, `n - m`, `n` and `m`, are its step.

With the identification in hand the geometric consequences are immediate: the distinguished point
is not torsion (`zsmul_point_ne_zero`), and `n ↦ n • point` is injective
(`Jacobian.zsmul_point_injective`). Next comes the Jacobian form of the identification, where
the three division polynomials appear as honest homogeneous coordinates `(φₙ : ωₙ : ψₙ)` and the
statement needs no hypothesis on `n` at all: at `n = 0` the triple is the point at infinity.

That Jacobian form is what lets Mathlib's doubling and addition formulas be run on the triple
directly. `dblXYZ_smulField` and `addXYZ_smulField` say that `dblXYZ` and `addXYZ` carry
`(φₙ : ωₙ : ψₙ)` to `(φ₂ₙ : ω₂ₙ : ψ₂ₙ)` and `(φₘ : ωₘ : ψₘ)`, `(φₙ : ωₙ : ψₙ)` to
`(φₙ₊ₘ : ωₙ₊ₘ : ψₙ₊ₘ)` scaled by `ψₙ₋ₘ` — as equalities of triples, not merely of the points they
represent, which is what makes them usable as rewrite rules. Both descend to `Universal.Ring`,
where they are identities between polynomials modulo the Weierstrass polynomial.

The file closes by specializing. A point `(x, y)` on a curve `W` over any commutative ring induces
`Universal.ringEval`, and `ringEval_comp_smulRing` says it carries the universal triple to
`smulEval W x y n`, the division polynomials of `W` evaluated at `(x, y)`. The three identities
above therefore hold for `W` at `(x, y)`, and feeding them to an even-odd induction proves
**`zsmul_point_eq_smulEval`**: over a field, `n • (x, y)` has Jacobian coordinates
`(φₙ(x,y) : ωₙ(x,y) : ψₙ(x,y))`, for every `n` and with no hypothesis on the characteristic. That
is the statement the Nagell–Lutz layer consumes.

## Main definitions

* `WeierstrassCurve.Universal.Affine.smulX`: the rational function `φₙ/ψₙ²`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Universal.Affine.smulY`: the rational function `ωₙ/ψₙ³`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Universal.Affine.slopeOne`: the slope of the tangent at `(X, Y)`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Universal.Jacobian.smulPoly`, `.smulRing`, `.smulField`: the triple
  `(φₙ, ωₙ, ψₙ)` as a `Fin 3 → _`, over the polynomial ring, the universal ring and the
  universal field respectively.
* `WeierstrassCurve.smulEval`: the same triple for a concrete curve `W`, evaluated at a point
  `(x, y)` of the affine plane over any commutative ring.

## Main results

* `WeierstrassCurve.Universal.Affine.smulX_eq`: `smulX n = smulX 1 - ψₙ₊₁ψₙ₋₁/ψₙ²` for `n ≠ 0`,
  the offset from the `X`-coordinate that `smulX_two` and `smulX_sub_smulX` both run through.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Universal.Affine.smulX_sub_smulX`: `smulX m - smulX n` as a single
  quotient, by the elliptic-sequence relation of the universal `ψ` family.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Universal.Affine.smulX_ne_zero`: `smulX n ≠ 0` for `n ≠ 0`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Universal.Affine.smulX_eq_smulX_iff`: `smulX m = smulX n ↔ m = n ∨ m = -n`,
  the field-level form of the fact that `x`-coordinates separate multiples up to sign.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Universal.Affine.smulY_neg`: for `n ≠ 0`, `smulY (-n)` is the `negY` of the
  coordinates at `n` — the long-Weierstrass correction that `ω_neg` carries, in the universal
  field.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Universal.Affine.smulY_sub_negY`: the gap `smulY n - negY (smulX n) (smulY n)`
  is `ψ₂ₙ/ψₙ⁴`, whence `smulY_ne_negY` — the gap never vanishes for `n ≠ 0`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Universal.Affine.slopeOne_eq_neg_div`: the tangent slope at `(X, Y)` is
  `-Wₓ/ψ₂`, the ratio of the two partial derivatives of the Weierstrass polynomial.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Universal.Affine.addX_smul_one_smul_one`,
  `.addY_smul_one_smul_one`: doubling `(X, Y)` along that tangent with Mathlib's affine addition
  formula returns `(smulX 2, smulY 2)` — the base case of the scalar-multiplication induction.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Universal.Affine.smulX_add`, `.smulY_add_sub_negY`: the chord formulas, giving
  `smulX (n + m)` and the vertical gap at `n + m` in terms of the values at `n`, `m` and `n - m`
  — the induction step.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Universal.Affine.zsmul_point_eq_smulX_smulY`: **the identification**. For
  `n ≠ 0` the pair `(smulX n, smulY n)` is nonsingular and `n • (X, Y)` is the affine point it
  names.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Universal.Affine.zsmul_point_ne_zero` and
  `WeierstrassCurve.Universal.Jacobian.zsmul_point_ne_zero`:
  the distinguished point is not torsion, in affine and in Jacobian coordinates; whence
  `Jacobian.zsmul_point_injective`, that `n ↦ n • point` is injective.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Universal.Jacobian.zsmul_point_eq_smulField`: the Jacobian identification,
  `(n • point).point = ⟦(φₙ : ωₙ : ψₙ)⟧`, with no hypothesis on `n`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Universal.Jacobian.dblXYZ_smulField`, `.addXYZ_smulField`: Mathlib's Jacobian
  doubling and addition formulas evaluated on the universal triples, as equalities of triples.
  `.dblXYZ_smulRing` and `.addXYZ_smulRing` are the same over `Universal.Ring`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Universal.Jacobian.dblZ_smulPoly`, `.addZ_smulPoly`: the `Z`-coordinates of
  those two formulas, `ψ₂ₙ` and `ψₙ₊ₘψₙ₋ₘ`, already in the polynomial ring — no reduction modulo
  the Weierstrass polynomial is needed for the third coordinate.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Universal.Jacobian.smulPoly_neg`, `.smulRing_neg`, `.smulField_neg`: negating
  the index is Mathlib's Jacobian negation rescaled by `-1`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Universal.ringEval_comp_smulRing`: `smulEval` is the specialization of
  `smulRing` along the homomorphism a point of `W` induces — the bridge from the universal
  identities to a concrete curve, and what `dblXYZ_smulEval` and `addXYZ_smulEval` are proved
  through.
* `WeierstrassCurve.zsmul_point_eq_smulEval`: **the headline**. Over a field, `n • (x, y)`
  in Jacobian
  coordinates is `(φₙ(x,y) : ωₙ(x,y) : ψₙ(x,y))`, for every nonsingular `(x, y)` and every `n`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.zsmul_eq_zero_of_evalEval_ψ_eq_zero`: **the converse** — a vanishing `ψₙ` at
  a nonsingular point forces `n • P = 0`. Unrestricted in `n`, and so an annihilation statement
  rather than a torsion one: at `n = 0` both sides hold of every point.
* `WeierstrassCurve.addOrderOf_eq_two_iff_evalEval_ψ₂_eq_zero`: those two directions packaged as
  the characterisation of two-torsion, `addOrderOf P = 2 ↔ ψ₂(x, y) = 0`. Its contrapositive is
  what discharges the `addOrderOf ≠ 2` guard the Nagell–Lutz theorems carry.

## Provenance

Ported from J. Xu and D. K. Angdinata's `projects/NagellLutz/LutzNagell/ZSMul.lean` in AINTLIB
(`github.com/CBirkbeck/AINTLIB`, Apache-2.0, `main @
1c1c74664e40071c2c2165bc55ca2616a67ccd6b`): `smulX` (`:164`), `smulY` (`:168`), the value
lemmas (`:171`–`:174`), `smulX_eq` (`:176`), `smulX_two` (`:183`), `smulX_sub_smulX` (`:186`),
`smulX_neg` (`:201`), `smulX_ne_zero` (`:203`), `smulX_ne_smulX` (`:206`),
`smulX_eq_smulX_iff` (`:217`), and `smulY_neg` (`:290`), pulled forward from the slope slice's
range so that `smulY` does not ship without its negative-index rule. The source's `ψᵤ`
abbreviation is dropped in favour of `polyToField (curve.ψ n)`, the
`DivisionPolynomial/Universal.lean` convention.

Five departures beyond that respelling. The elliptic-sequence step of `smulX_sub_smulX` is
respelt through `IsEllipticNet.rel` and `linear_combination` (the source converts against its
`isEllSequence_ψᵤ`, a statement shape Mathlib has since replaced). The equation lemmas
`smulX_def` and `smulY_def` are added for consumers in other modules, as in `Omega.lean`.
`smulY_neg` reads its coordinate identity off Mathlib's `Jacobian.negY_of_Z_ne_zero` at
`(φₙ : ωₙ : ψₙ)` instead of the source's private field-level auxiliary (`:286`), still naming
its ring hom (`map_neg polyToField`) where the source unfolds `ψᵤ`, because an unnamed
`map_neg` does not fire on a `polyToField` application in this direction. `smulX_eq` meets that
same direction problem — the source's forward
`simp only [φ, ψᵤ, map_sub, map_mul, map_pow, ← add_div]` does not fire here — so it instead
maps a polynomial-level identity with `congrArg polyToField` and clears the denominator with
`field_simp` and `linear_combination`. Finally `@[simp]` is added to `smulX_neg`, `smulY_neg`,
`smulX_ne_zero` and `smulX_eq_smulX_iff`; the source tags only the four value lemmas.

The tangent-and-doubling block below adds, at the same revision, `smulY_sub_negY` (`:227`),
`slopeOne` (`:241`), `slopeOne_eq_neg_div` (`:244`), `addX_smul_one_smul_one` (`:261`) and
`addY_smul_one_smul_one` (`:277`), with the same `ψᵤ` respelling and one added equation lemma,
`slopeOne_def`.

One statement is generalised rather than transcribed, and the source's two `n = 1` wrappers go
with it. The source proves only `smulY_one_ne_negY` (`:237`); here `smulY_ne_negY` states it for
every `n ≠ 0`, which `smulY_sub_negY` already gives — the gap `ψ₂ₙ/ψₙ⁴` is a quotient of nonzero
elements. Given the general form, both of the source's specialisations are **dropped rather than
ported**: `smulY_one_ne_negY` (`:237`) is `smulY_ne_negY one_ne_zero` and is written that way at
its two call sites, and `smulY_one_sub_negY` (`:233`) is `smulY_sub_negY one_ne_zero` followed by
the collapse of `ψ₂ₙ` to `ψ₂` and `ψₙ⁴` to `1`, which its one consumer `slopeOne_eq_neg_div`
carries as a local `have`.

None of the source's four private field-level auxiliaries in that range is ported, because none
of them has a consumer left here.

* `smulY_sub_negY_aux` (`:222`) is not needed: `smulY_sub_negY` runs through this file's own
  `smulY_neg` — negating the index negates the point — which already reads its coordinate identity
  off Mathlib's `Jacobian.negY_of_Z_ne_zero`. What is left is `ω_neg`, `ω_spec` and `ψ_mul_ψc`,
  with no field-level algebra to package.
* `addX_smul_one_smul_one_aux` (`:252`) has no call site **in the source either**: at
  `1c1c7466` the name occurs exactly once repo-wide per copy, its own definition.
* `addX_smul_ring_identity` (`:257`) and `addY_smul_one_smul_one_aux` (`:271`) each package the
  residue of one `field_simp` in the source's normal form. Both residues differ here, and
  `linear_combination` against the mapped certificate, respectively `ring`, closes each in a line.

Two further departures. Mathlib's `Affine.slope` is defined by cases, and the source supplies the
decidability it needs with a namespace-wide `attribute [local instance] Classical.propDecidable`
(`:159`, and again at `:406`). Nothing of the kind is needed here: Mathlib carries
`FractionRing.instDecidableEq`, so `DecidableEq Universal.Field` synthesizes outright — checked
with `#synth`, which returns that instance — and every declaration in this file mentioning
`slope` or the Jacobian group law elaborates without any `Classical`.
And the map-direction problem recorded above for `smulX_eq` recurs at every proof in the block.
Measured against the `unusedSimpArgs` linter at this pin: bare `map_sub` and `map_neg` fire at no
site, while bare `map_mul`, `map_add`, `map_pow` and `map_ofNat` fire at all of them — the
unexposed instances are `Sub` and `Neg`. Each `map_*` names its hom regardless, for uniformity
with the rest of the file. Naming alone is not enough in the last three proofs, which state their
polynomial-level certificate as a `have` and map it with `congrArg polyToField`, the shape
`smulX_eq` uses: `polyToField_apply` is `@[simp]` here, so `field_simp` shatters
`polyToField (C X)` into `algebraMap _ _ (AdjoinRoot.of _ X)` while leaving
`polyToField curve.polynomialX` folded, and the two sides of the goal then share no atoms.

The identification block below adds, at the same revision,
`smulX_add` (`:300`), `smulY_add_sub_negY` (`:324`), `eq_of_sub_negY_eq` (`:345`),
`zsmul_point_eq_smulX_smulY` (`:353`),
`Affine.zsmul_point_ne_zero` (`:398`), `Jacobian.zsmul_point_ne_zero` (`:411`),
`Jacobian.zsmul_point_injective` (`:416`), `smulPoly`, `smulRing` and
`smulField` (`:423`–`:427`), `algebraMap_comp_smulRing` (`:429`) and
`Jacobian.zsmul_point_eq_smulField` (`:433`). The first three come from before the previous
slice's range: they are the chord formulas, and the headline induction step cannot be stated
without them. The source's `curveField` has no counterpart here and is spelled
`pointedCurve.toAffine`.

One prerequisite is **strengthened rather than transcribed**, in
`DivisionPolynomial/Universal.lean`: what was `isEllipticSequence_polyToField_ψ` is now
`isEllipticNet_polyToField_ψ`, the source's `net_ψᵤ` (`:140`) rather than its
`isEllSequence_ψᵤ` (`:139`). `smulY_add_sub_negY` needs the elliptic-net relation at the
**nonzero** shift `s = m`, which an elliptic sequence — the `s = 0` case — does not give;
`isEllipticNet_normEDS` was already available, so the change is two tokens, and
`smulX_sub_smulX`, the one existing call site, takes the `s = 0` instance.

`eq_of_sub_negY_eq` is the first consumer of `(2 : Universal.Field) ≠ 0`. No instance is added for
it: Mathlib's `charZero` for a fraction ring carries `CharZero Universal.Field` from
`CharZero Universal.Ring`, and `EllipticCurve/Universal.lean` imports `Algebra/CharP/Algebra.lean`
so that it is in scope.

One statement is restated. The source's `zsmul_point_ne` (`:416`) is the pairwise form
`m ≠ n → m • point ≠ n • point`; here it is `zsmul_point_injective`, the equivalent
`Function.Injective fun n : ℤ ↦ n • Jacobian.point`, which says the same thing in the idiom the
rest of the library uses and composes with the `Function.Injective` API.

Five departures inside the block itself. The source's `some_eq_some_iff` (used at `:372`) is
**not** added: Mathlib's spelling is the auto-generated `Affine.Point.some.injEq`, which Mathlib
itself uses, and `EllipticCurve/Universal.lean` records that this repository declines `Iff`
wrappers around auto-generated `injEq`s. The source's two `erw`s (`:363`, `:372`) are both gone:
the first only bridged `((0 + 1 + 1 : ℕ) : ℤ)` to `(2 : ℤ)`, which an explicit cast rewrite
does, and the second additionally saw through `Affine.Point.neg_some`, which is a named `rfl`
lemma and can simply be cited. The `n = 1` instance of the induction hypothesis is obtained at an
ascribed type so that its index cast is normalised **before** the pair is destructured: afterwards
the nonsingularity witness mentions the cast, and no rewrite of the equation alone is
type-correct. And the two chord formulas are stated without the source's cosmetic
`let ψ₂ x y := y - negY x y` binder, which the source immediately removes again with `change`.
And of the block's two candidate `@[simp]` lemmas only `algebraMap_comp_smulRing` carries the
tag. `zsmul_point_eq_smulField` cannot: `Jacobian.point_def` and `Affine.point_def` are both
`@[simp]`, so simpNF reports the left-hand side `(n • Jacobian.point).point` as not in normal
form — it reduces to `(Point.fromAffine (Affine.Point.mk ⋯)).point` before the lemma could fire.
It was tagged and rejected by a full `lint-env` run before being left untagged.

Three declarations of the source's are not ported. Its `smulX_add_aux` (`:295`) and
`smulY_add_sub_negY_aux` (`:317`) each package the residue of one `field_simp`; both residues
differ here and are closed in place. Its `net_add_sub_iff`, which lives in
`LutzNagell/EllipticDivisibilitySequence.lean` rather than in this file, is inlined as the local
`key` of `smulY_add_sub_negY` — normalising the eight index sums of `IsEllipticNet.rel` needs
`linear_combination (norm := ring_nf)`, since `ring1` does not reduce inside `curve.ψ`'s argument.
The source's `instance : AddGroup ((curve.baseChange Universal.Field).toAffine.Point)` (`:341`) is
an `inferInstance` cache and is not needed, and neither is its second
`attribute [local instance] Classical.propDecidable` (`:406`), for the reason already given.

The final block below completes the port of the source file, adding, at the same revision,
`dblZ_smulPoly` (`:446`), `nonsingular_smulField` (`:454`), `dblXYZ_smulField` (`:469`),
`dblXYZ_smulRing` (`:480`), `addZ_smulPoly` (`:484`), `smulPoly_neg` (`:496`),
`smulRing_neg` (`:499`), `smulField_neg` (`:502`), `smulPoly_zero` and
`smulField_zero` (`:505`–`:506`), `addXYZ_smulField` (`:508`), `addXYZ_smulRing` (`:533`),
then `smulEval` (`:560`), `ringEval_comp_smulRing` (`:566`), `dblXYZ_smulEval` (`:577`),
`addXYZ_smulEval` (`:581`) and `zsmul_eq_smulEval` (`:599`), the last ported under the name
`zsmul_point_eq_smulEval` because its conclusion is about the `.point` projection. The three
`₁`-suffixed
adjacent-index lemmas (`:539`, `:546`, `:589`) are in the source's range but are **not** ported,
for the reason given below.
The two zero lemmas are moved ahead of `dblXYZ_smulField`, which uses `smulField_zero` to
identify the `n = 0` triple; the source proves that case by unfolding `dblXYZ` instead.
`ringEval_comp_smulRing` is placed in the `Universal` namespace rather than at
`WeierstrassCurve` level as upstream, matching where `EllipticCurve/Universal.lean` keeps the rest
of the `ringEval` API. The source's `curveRing_map_ringEval` is this repository's `map_ringEval`.
The source's `ringEval_ψ` (`:572`) is **not ported**: it is the third coordinate of
`ringEval_comp_smulRing`, used once, so it lives as a typed local `have` in `addXYZ_smulEval`
rather than as public API.
The source's `ω_neg_eq_neg_negY` (`:489`) is **not ported**: it is `ω_neg` followed by `negY_eq`
and `ring`, and `smulPoly_neg` — its only advertised consumer — discharges the middle coordinate
through the default `simp` set instead, so the intermediate lemma has no caller.

**None of the source's three `₁`-suffixed adjacent-index lemmas is ported** (`:539`, `:546`,
`:589`). Each is its `addXYZ_smul{Field,Ring,Eval}` parent followed by `add_sub_cancel_left`,
`ψ_one`, `map_one`/`evalEval_one` and `one_smul` — the scaling factor at adjacent indices is
`ψ` of a gap of `1`. Only the `Eval` form ever had a consumer, and only one, so those four
rewrites are appended to that call site's own `rw` chain instead; the intermediate
specialisations earn nothing.

**`point_point` (`:420`) is not ported at all, and the previous slice's copy of it is deleted
here.** That slice predicted this block would supply a consumer; it does not. At `1c1c7466` the
source's `point_point` occurs exactly once per copy — its own definition — so nothing consumes it
upstream either, and it restates `Jacobian.point_def`, `Affine.point_def` and
`Point.fromAffine_some` without adding content. `algebraMap_comp_smulRing` (`:429`), predicted
alongside it, **is** consumed — cited four times
across `dblXYZ_smulRing`, `addXYZ_smulRing` and `smulField_neg`. It is load-bearing rather than
decorative: upstream `algebraMap _ _ ∘ smulRing n = smulField n` holds by `rfl`, and here it does
not, `polyToField`'s body being unexposed.

One prerequisite is added, in `EllipticCurve/Universal.lean`: `map_polyToField`, for the same
reason. Upstream `curveField = curvePoly.map polyToField` definitionally, so a curve-dependent
transport such as `map_dblZ` lands on `curveField` with no further step; here it lands on
`curvePoly.map polyToField` and the identification has to be cited. Both proofs that cite it do so
after `map_dblZ`. `map_addZ` is not in that class: `addZ` takes no curve argument, so its transport
never mentions a mapped curve. `map_polyToField` carries `@[simp]`, as does
`ringEval_comp_smulRing`: both are map-specialization normal forms, reducing a mapped universal
object to the concrete one it names, and neither loops. `api-design` asked for both tags in round
three, over an initial judgement here that two explicit call sites did not warrant the global
surface; the normal-form reading is the better one, and a full `lint-env` confirms neither tag
introduces a simpNF violation.

Two of the source's proofs are replaced rather than transcribed, both because a tactic upstream
relies on is unavailable over `Poly = ℤ[A₁,⋯,A₆][X][Y]`. Instance search gives up on that
triple-nested polynomial ring — `IsRightCancelAdd Poly` and `HasDistribNeg Poly` both fail to
synthesize in this import closure, while their two-level analogues succeed and raising
`synthInstance.maxSize` does not help. So `addZ_smulPoly` discharges its elliptic-sequence
certificate through `sub_eq_zero` and `ring` where the source uses `convert`, and `smulPoly_neg`
is proved coordinatewise with `ring` where the source uses a single `simp` carrying
`Odd.neg_pow`. `ring` itself works over `Poly`; it is the additive-cancellation and sign lemmas
that are out of reach.

`ringEval_comp_smulRing` is also proved differently. The source threads a nine-lemma `conv_rhs`
chain that ends by unfolding `polyEval`; that definition's body is unexposed here. The proof
instead runs coordinatewise through `ringEval_mk` and `evalEval_φ`/`evalEval_ω`/`evalEval_ψ`,
which `DivisionPolynomial/Universal.lean` already carries — the source's own `:99`–`:106`, ported
in an earlier slice and, before this proof, cited nowhere outside their own file.

Finally the source's two private helpers in this range, `two_zsmul_point_eq_dblXYZ` (`:458`) and
`add_point_of_ne_eq_addXYZ` (`:463`), are **not** ported as declarations. Each has exactly one
call site and one instantiation, so each is inlined as a typed local `have` — `h2` in
`dblXYZ_smulField` and `hadd` in `addXYZ_smulField` — which keeps both proofs inside the length
cap. The source's `zsmul_point_ne`, which `add_point_of_ne_eq_addXYZ` consumes, is this file's
`zsmul_point_injective`, so the distinctness side condition is discharged through injectivity.

/-- **A root of `ψₙ` is annihilated by `n`**, the converse of
`evalEval_ψ_eq_zero_of_zsmul_eq_zero`. If `ψₙ` vanishes at `P` then `n • P = 0`.

Stated as annihilation rather than torsion, and deliberately left unrestricted in `n`. At `n = 0`
it is tautological on both sides — `ψ₀ = 0` vanishes at every point and `0 • P = 0` for every `P` —
so that case exhibits no torsion and the equation carries no content there. Genuine torsion at
an index needs `n ≠ 0` in addition. -/

`ΨSqₙ` is the square of `Ψₙ`, which on the curve is `ψₙ`, so this is the `ψ`-criterion above read
through the two evaluation bridges. Both directions hold pointwise, for a supplied `y` completing
`x` to a point: no closure assumption is needed, because the point is given rather than produced,
and no ellipticity, because neither bridge uses it. -/

/-- **Torsion transports between the affine and Jacobian point groups.** `n • P = 0` affinely,
with `n : ℕ`, is the same statement as `(n : ℤ) • P = 0` on the Jacobian side.

Stated as an **iff** because both directions are wanted: `addOrderOf` is `ℕ`-valued and affine
while the theorems above take their torsion hypothesis on `Jacobian.Point.fromAffine`, so a
vanishing statement travels forwards and a non-vanishing one backwards. The proof is the additive
equivalence alone, so `P` ranges over every affine point, the point at infinity included.

The integer-scalar form `zsmul_fromAffine_eq_zero_iff_zsmul_eq_zero` is the one this rests on;
the `ℕ`-cast reading below is its specialisation, and is what a consumer holding an `ℕ`-torsion
hypothesis wants.

**Not a `simp` lemma.** Its left-hand side is not in simp normal form: `natCast_zsmul` rewrites
`(n : ℤ) • Q` to `n • Q`, so tagging it `@[simp]` fails `simpNF`. The `ℤ`-cast orientation is
nevertheless the useful one, because every consumer's torsion hypothesis is a `ℤ`-scalar
multiple; stating it in `ℕ`-normal form would only move the cast to each call site. -/

/-- **Two-torsion is exactly the vanishing of `ψ₂`.** For a nonsingular affine point, having order
two and `ψ₂` vanishing there are the same condition. Forwards, order two gives `2 • P = 0` and
`evalEval_ψ_eq_zero_of_zsmul_eq_zero` at `n = 2` reads off the vanishing; backwards,
`zsmul_eq_zero_of_evalEval_ψ_eq_zero` at `n = 2` gives `2 • P = 0`, so the order divides `2`, and
a `.some` point is never `0`, which rules out `1`. Both directions cross between `ψ 2` and `ψ₂`
by `ψ_two`.

Stated over the point's own field, with no arithmetic on the coefficients: consumers working over
a fraction field transport their hypothesis across `algebraMap` at the call site.

**Not a `simp` lemma.** Neither side is a normal form the other should rewrite towards, and both
directions are wanted — the `≠`-form below is what discharges Nagell–Lutz's guard, while the
`= 2` direction is what an order computation wants. -/
