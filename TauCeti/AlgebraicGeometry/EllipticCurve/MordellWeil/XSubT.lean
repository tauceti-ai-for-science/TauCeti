# The `x - T` map of an elliptic curve into its étale algebra

Let `W : y² = f(x) = x³ + a₂x² + a₄x + a₆` be an elliptic curve in characteristic `≠ 2` normal
form over a field `K`, and let `A := K[X]⧸⟨f⟩` be the étale algebra of `f`. The **descent map**,
or `x - T` map, sends a point of `W` to the square class of `x - T` in `A`, where `T` is the
class of `X`. It is the engine of the descent computing `E(K)/2E(K)`: its kernel is exactly
`2E(K)`, so `E(K)/2E(K)` embeds into a group of square classes, which is finite under the
finiteness hypotheses of the weak Mordell-Weil theorem.

The subtlety is at the `2`-torsion. If `f x ≠ 0` then `x - T` is already a unit of `A`, but at a
root `x` of `f` the element `x - T` is a zero divisor, and the map instead returns the class of
the corrected representative `x - T + fCofactor x`. Adding `fCofactor x` changes nothing modulo
`fCofactor x`, where the element still agrees with `x - T`; at the remaining factor, where
`x - T` vanishes, it takes the value `f' x`, which is nonzero because `f` is separable. That is
what makes the corrected element a unit. Both branches are packaged in `μX`, and `μ₀` extends
`μX` by sending the point at infinity to `1`.

## Main definitions

* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.μX`, `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.μ₀`: the `x - T` map, first on
  `x`-coordinates and then on points, as a plain function.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.μ`: the same map upgraded to a group homomorphism
  `Multiplicative W.Point →* W.M`.

## Main results

* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.μ₀_mul_mul_eq_one_of_add_add_eq_zero`: the square classes of three
  collinear points multiply to `1`. This is the substance of the file, and the multiplicativity
  that makes `μ` a homomorphism; it is proved by exhibiting an explicit square root in each of
  the ways the three points can meet the `2`-torsion.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.exists_eq_two_smul_iff`: a point is divisible by `2` exactly when an
  explicit polynomial identity has a solution. This is the bridge from the `x - T` map to the
  kernel computation below.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.ker_μ_eq`: **the kernel of `μ` is exactly `2 • W(K)`**. This is the
  injectivity half of the descent, and the reason `W(K)/2W(K)` embeds into `W.M`. A point in the
  kernel is exhibited as `2 • P` by solving the identity of `exists_eq_two_smul_iff` from a square
  root of `x - T`, in two cases according to whether the `x`-coordinate is a root of `f`; the
  point-wise statement is `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.eq_two_smul_of_μ_eq_one`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.normM`, `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.range_μ_le_ker_normM`: the norm map
  on square classes, and **the norm condition on the image of the descent map** — every square
  class in the image of `μ` has square norm. This is what the `2`-descent tests a class against.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.norm_mk_C_sub_X_add_fCofactor`: at a root of `f`, the corrected
  representative `x - T + fCofactor x` has norm `(f' x) ^ 2`. This is the value the norm condition
  on the image of the descent map is read off from at the `2`-torsion.

`WeierstrassCurve.Affine.A` is the étale algebra and `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.M` its group of
square classes of units; `M` is spelled as a quotient of `W.Aˣ` by the range of Mathlib's
`powMonoidHom 2`, which is the same spelling that `TauCeti/GroupTheory/Finiteness.lean` already
uses for square classes.

## Namespace

These declarations extend Mathlib's own `WeierstrassCurve.Affine` namespace rather than sitting
under `TauCeti`. That is forced by dot notation: `Affine` is a reducible abbreviation for
`WeierstrassCurve`, so `W.f` is resolved by a direct lookup on the structure's namespace and a
`TauCeti.`-prefixed copy is never found. Writing `f W` throughout instead would diverge from the
source for no gain. `TauCeti/RingTheory/AdjoinRoot/Basic.lean` sets the same precedent for a file
whose whole content extends a Mathlib namespace.

## Provenance

Adapted, with the author's proofs, from Michael Stoll's `EllipticCurves` project
(`github.com/MichaelStollBayreuth/EllipticCurves`, Apache-2.0, revision `66889eada51a`),
`EllipticCurves/WeakMordellWeil.lean` lines 60-798, which are that file's Steps 2 and 3,
the divisibility criterion opening its Step 4, and Step 4 itself — the kernel computation.
The source is written against Lean `v4.32.0`; this is a forward port.

Two changes were made against the source. Stoll defines the square classes through a local
abbreviation `Units.modPow`; here they are the quotient by `(powMonoidHom 2).range` directly, so
that TauCeti carries a single spelling of square classes. In the kernel proofs this replaces the
source's `Units.modPow.unit_eq_one_iff` step by
`TauCeti.powMonoidHom_range_mk_eq_one_iff_exists_pow`, which says
the same thing about this spelling, for any commutative monoid. `norm_mk_C_sub_X_add_fCofactor`
is the source's Step 5 opening, `WeakMordellWeil.lean` lines 284-313, specialised here from the
general `AdjoinRoot.norm_mk_C_sub_X_add`, which carries that attribution. The rest of that step —
the induced norm map on square classes and the containment of the image of `μ` in its kernel — is
`WeakMordellWeil.lean` lines 873-919. It is adapted rather than copied: Stoll builds the map as
`Units.modPow.map (Algebra.norm K) 2` through his local square-class abbreviation, and the single
spelling this repo carries makes it a `QuotientGroup.map` into `Kˣ ⧸ (powMonoidHom 2).range`
instead.

### Commutative-ring and polynomial identities

These encode the multiplicativity of the `x - T` map on the level of coordinates, and are used
only in the proof that `μ` is a homomorphism. The polynomial ones are sign normalisations: the
representatives are naturally written `C x - X`, while `f` factors into `X - C x`, and each
rewriting step below turns one into the other.

### The norm at the `2`-torsion

At a root `x` of `f` the descent map uses the corrected representative `x - T + fCofactor x`, and
the norm condition on the image of the map is read off from its norm, which is a square. The
computation is `AdjoinRoot.norm_mk_C_sub_X_add`, stated there for any monic polynomial split off
a linear factor; here it is specialised to `f = fCofactor x * (X - C x)`. The other value the
condition needs, the norm of `x - T` itself on the branch where that is already a unit, is
`AdjoinRoot.norm_algebraMap_sub_root W.monic_f x`.
-/

/-- At a root of `f`, the corrected representative `x - T + fCofactor x` has norm
`(f' x) ^ 2`, where `f' x = 3 * x ^ 2 + 2 * a₂ * x + a₄`. This coefficient identity holds
without a normal-form or ellipticity hypothesis. Over a field, `deriv_f_ne_zero` supplies the
nonvanishing needed to read the norm as a square class of units. -/

`M.inv_eq_self`: every element is its own inverse), so `W.M` is an elementary abelian `2`-group.

The instance is stated rather than left to `inferInstance`: the latter succeeds on the spot, but
instance search does not find it at the use sites below (e.g. for `mul_right_comm` in
`μX_mul_mul_eq_one`) unless it is declared here. -/

### Step 3: `μ` is a homomorphism

Multiplicativity is the statement that the square classes of three collinear points multiply to
`1`. The proof splits on how many of the three `x`-coordinates are roots of `f`, i.e. on how many
of the points are `2`-torsion, and in each case exhibits an explicit square root of the product of
the three representatives.

product of the three linear factors `X - C x` is `f` minus the square of a polynomial of degree
at most `1`, namely the line through them. -/

### The divisibility criterion

What belongs here is the criterion the kernel computation runs on, namely that divisibility by
`2` is equivalent to an explicit polynomial identity. `exists_eq_two_smul_iff'` restates it inside
`W.A`, which is the form the square-class argument consumes; the section below runs that argument
and concludes in `ker_μ_eq`.

the polynomial identity: the point `(ξ, lξ + m)` lies on `W` and doubles to `(x, ±y)`. -/

### The kernel of the `x - T` map

Both inclusions of `ker_μ_eq`. That `2 • P` is killed is `μ₀_two_nsmul`; the converse is trivial at
the point at infinity and, at an affine point, splits on whether `f` vanishes at the `x`-coordinate.
Each affine branch feeds the criterion of the previous section a square root extracted from
`μ (some x y h) = 1`.

### The norm map on square classes

`Algebra.norm K : W.A →* K` carries units to units and squares to squares, so it descends to the
square classes: `normM` sends the class of `u : W.Aˣ` to the class of its norm in
`Kˣ ⧸ (powMonoidHom 2).range`, the ambient of Mathlib's Selmer group. Both branches of `μX` have
square norm — off the `2`-torsion the norm of `x - T` is `f x`, which the curve equation makes
`y ^ 2`, and at a root of `f` the norm of the corrected representative is `(f' x) ^ 2` — so the
image of `μ` lies in the kernel of `normM`. That containment is the norm condition the `2`-descent
reads off the image of the descent map.
