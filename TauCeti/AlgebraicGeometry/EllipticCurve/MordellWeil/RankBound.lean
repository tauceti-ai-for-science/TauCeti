# Finiteness of the 2-Selmer group over a number field, and the rank bound

Let `W : y² = f(x) = x³ + a₂x² + a₄x + a₆` be an elliptic curve in characteristic `≠ 2` normal
form over a number field `F`, with square classes `W.M` in its étale algebra `F[X] ⧸ (f)`. The
explicit `2`-Selmer group `W.selmerGroup₂ (𝓞 F) Loc` is cut out of `W.M` by the norm condition and
by the local `2`-descent conditions at every finite place of `F` and at each member of an
auxiliary family `Loc` of `F`-fields (classically, the completions at the infinite places).

This file proves that this group is **finite**, for every auxiliary family `Loc`, and turns that
into the **Mordell–Weil rank bound**
`2 ^ rank W(F) * #W(F)[2] ≤ #Sel₂(W/F)`. The bound becomes an explicit numerical bound on the
rank only once the Selmer group has been computed; no such computation is made here.

The finiteness argument is short. At every finite place `v`, the local descent image over the
completion `F_v` is unramified away from the bad primes of the base-changed curve over
`𝒪_v` (`range_μ_le_selmerGroupA`, applied over `F_v`), so a Selmer class localizes to an
unramified class at every good place. By the semilocal comparison
(`mem_selmerGroupA_of_forall_localRes`) it is then `S`-unramified globally, `S` the bad primes
of `W` over `𝓞 F`. So the `2`-Selmer group lies in `A(S, 2)`, and `A(S, 2)` is finite by the
class number theorem and Dirichlet's unit theorem for the field factors of the étale algebra
(`finite_selmerGroupA`).

## Main results

* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.selmerGroup₂_le_selmerGroupA`: over a number field, every
  `2`-Selmer class is unramified outside the bad primes, `Sel₂(W/F) ≤ A(S, 2)`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.finite_selmerGroup₂`: the `2`-Selmer group of an elliptic curve
  over a number field is finite.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.pow_rank_le_card_selmerGroup₂`: the rank bound
  `2 ^ rank W(F) * #W(F)[2] ≤ #Sel₂(W/F)`.

## Provenance

The statement `finite_selmerGroup₂` follows Michael Stoll's `EllipticCurves` project
(`github.com/MichaelStollBayreuth/EllipticCurves`, Apache-2.0, commit `66889eada51a`),
`EllipticCurves/SelmerGroup.lean`, there stated for the family of completions at the infinite
places. The source deduces it from its reduction of the `2`-Selmer group to the bad places,
whose proof needs a count of the local descent image at every good place; here only the
inclusion `Sel₂(W/F) ≤ A(S, 2)` is needed, and it follows directly from the semilocal comparison
(adapted from the same source) together with Step 6 of weak Mordell–Weil applied over each
completion.
