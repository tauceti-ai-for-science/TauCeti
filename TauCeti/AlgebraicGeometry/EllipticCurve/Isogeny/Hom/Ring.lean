# The endomorphism ring of an elliptic curve

Composition of morphisms of elliptic curves is additive in the outer morphism by construction
(`TauCeti.Isogeny.Hom.add_comp`), the sum of morphisms being computed on their tautological points.
This file proves that it is additive in the inner morphism as well, over every field, so that
composition is biadditive and the endomorphisms `Hom W W` of an elliptic curve form a ring
(Silverman III.4).

Additivity in the inner morphism is a statement about points: two morphisms are equal once they
agree on infinitely many points, so over a separably closed field `h ∘ (f + g) = h ∘ f + h ∘ g`
follows once `h` acts additively on points (`TauCeti.Isogeny.Hom.comp_add_of_pointMap_add`). That
every morphism acts additively on points is Silverman III.4.8. A separable isogeny over a
separably closed field acts through the class-group point map, which is additive by construction
(`TauCeti.Isogeny.Hom.pointMap_ofIsogeny_eq_toPointHom`). Every isogeny factors as a separable one
after a Frobenius power `F^r : W → W⁽ᵖʳ⁾` (Silverman II.2.12), and `F^r` sends `(x, y)` to
`(x ^ p ^ r, y ^ p ^ r)` (`TauCeti.Isogeny.pointMap_iterateRelativeFrobeniusIsogeny`), which is
additive because the Frobenius of the field is a ring homomorphism. Over an arbitrary field, both
additivity statements are compared after base change to a separable closure: on points, which embed
additively and compatibly with the action of morphisms (`TauCeti.Isogeny.Hom.pointMap_map`), and on
morphisms, along the faithful, additive base change (`TauCeti.Isogeny.Hom.map_injective`).

## Main results

* `TauCeti.Isogeny.Hom.pointMap_add`: every morphism acts additively on points, over any field
  (Silverman III.4.8), with `pointMap_neg`, `pointMap_sub`, `pointMap_nsmul` and `pointMap_zsmul`.
* `TauCeti.Isogeny.Hom.comp_add`: composition is additive in the inner morphism, over any field.
* `TauCeti.Isogeny.Hom.compLeftHom`: postcomposition by a morphism, as an additive homomorphism.
* The `Ring (Hom W W)`, `IsDomain (Hom W W)` and `CharZero (Hom W W)` instances.
* `TauCeti.Isogeny.Hom.mapRingHom`: base change of endomorphisms, as a ring homomorphism.
