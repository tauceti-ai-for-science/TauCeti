# Negation

The involution `(x, y) ↦ (x, -y - a₁x - a₃)` of a Weierstrass curve is negation for the group
law. Its pullback on functions is `CoordinateRing.conj`, the conjugation of the coordinate ring
over `F[X]`, so negation is an isogeny of `W` with itself, an involution, and of degree one.

Postcomposing with it negates on the hom carrier, which is the `Neg` structure the carrier's
additive group is built from. That this pullback really is negation, and not just some involution
of degree one, is `tautologicalPoint_negPullback`: its tautological point is the negated generic
point.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.Isogeny.negPullback`: the coordinate pullback `x ↦ conj x`.
* `TauCeti.Isogeny.negIsogeny`: the same map packaged as an `Isogeny W W`.
* `TauCeti.Isogeny.Hom.instNeg`: negation on `Hom W₁ W₂`, by postcomposition.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.Isogeny.negIsogeny_comp_negIsogeny`: negation is an involution.
* `TauCeti.Isogeny.degree_negIsogeny`: negation has degree one, so it is an automorphism of `W`
  fixing the point at infinity.
* `TauCeti.Isogeny.fieldPullback_negIsogeny_genericX` and
  `TauCeti.Isogeny.fieldPullback_negIsogeny_genericY`: on functions, negation fixes `x` and sends
  `y` to `-y - a₁x - a₃`.
* `TauCeti.Isogeny.Hom.neg_comp` and `TauCeti.Isogeny.Hom.degree_neg`: negation passes through
  composition, and preserves degrees, on the carrier.
* `TauCeti.Isogeny.Hom.ofIsogeny_negIsogeny`: the negation isogeny is `-1` among the endomorphisms.
* `TauCeti.Isogeny.tautologicalPoint_negPullback`: read at the generic point, negation is the
  group law's inverse — which is what identifies this pullback as negation rather than merely
  some degree-one involution.

The `MapsInfinity` condition says each `x` of the coordinate ring is integral over the pulled-back
copy. Conjugation is an *equivalence*, so every function is the pullback of its own conjugate — the
algebraic form of "negation fixes the point at infinity".
