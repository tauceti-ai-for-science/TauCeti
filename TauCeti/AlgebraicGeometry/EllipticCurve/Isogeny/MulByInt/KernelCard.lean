# The kernel of `[n]` has `n ²` points

`Isogeny.ker` counts only the base field's points, so its order equals the degree exactly when the
geometric kernel is **rational** and the isogeny is **separable**: an inseparable isogeny has
strictly fewer geometric kernel points than its degree even over an algebraically closed field.
Separability of `[n]` is `n` being invertible in the base. Rationality is the other hypothesis, and
it is the one that decides how general the statement is.

So the count is proved once with rationality as a hypothesis, and a closure assumption enters only
in a corollary. An algebraically closed base gives rationality outright — no extension of it
carries new torsion — which is `card_ker_mulByIntIsogeny_of_isAlgClosed` below. Keeping the
hypothesis explicit is what lets the count be read at a base where the torsion is rational for
some other reason, without the argument being repeated.

The count is made on embeddings, as for `1 − π_q`: an isogeny here has no map on points. Two
embeddings of `K(W)` over the pulled-back field move the tautological point of `[n]`, which is
`n` times the generic point, to the same place, so the two images of the generic point differ by an
`n`-torsion point — and rationality is exactly what puts that difference in the kernel. An embedding
is determined by where it sends the generic point, so that assignment is injective into the kernel,
and the separable degree is the number of embeddings.

The extension rationality is needed over is `AlgebraicClosure W.FunctionField`, because
`Field.Emb K L` is `L →ₐ[K] AlgebraicClosure K`: the embeddings being counted land in the algebraic
closure of the pulled-back field, so that is where the torsion difference lives.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.Isogeny.zsmul_map_sub_map_genericPoint_eq_zero`: two embeddings of `K(W)` agreeing on
  the field pulled back by `[n]` move the generic point by an `n`-torsion difference.
* `TauCeti.Isogeny.card_ker_mulByIntIsogeny_of_torsion_rational`: **`#ker [n] = n ²`** whenever the
  geometric `n`-torsion is rational and `n` is invertible.
* `TauCeti.Isogeny.card_ker_mulByIntIsogeny_of_isAlgClosed`: the same over an algebraically closed
  field.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.natCard_torsionBy_of_torsion_rational`: the count read on Mathlib's
  intrinsic torsion subgroup.
* `TauCeti.Isogeny.card_ker_mulByPrimeIsogeny_of_torsion_rational`: the same at a prime, as `ℓ ²`
  rather than `(ℓ : ℤ).natAbs ^ 2`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.finite_torsionBy`: finiteness of `E[n]` for nonzero `n`, read on
  `W.toAffine.Point` itself rather than on the trivial base change `W⁄K`.

Of the three steps of the argument sketched above, the torsion difference is public: it holds
over any extension, with no rationality, and bounds the separable degree of `[n]` by the geometric
`n`-torsion wherever that is trivial. Its rationality and the resulting bound on embeddings are
`private`; nothing outside this module uses them.

`Isogeny.ker` counts the base field's points, so the count is the degree exactly when the kernel is
rational and the isogeny separable. Both obstructions are hypotheses here: rationality is `hrat`,
separability is `hchar`. An algebraically closed base supplies the first for free, which is
`card_ker_mulByIntIsogeny_of_isAlgClosed`. -/
