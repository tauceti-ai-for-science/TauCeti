# Division polynomials are separable when `n` is invertible

`preΨₙ` has degree `(n ² - 1) / 2` for odd `n` and `(n ² - 4) / 2` for even `n`, and its roots are
the abscissae of the nonzero `n`-torsion points that are not `2`-torsion. Over an algebraically
closed field there are `n ² - 1` of the former and at most three of the latter, and the abscissa map
is two-to-one, so the roots are as numerous as the degree allows: `preΨₙ` has no repeated root.
The same count against `deg ΨSq₂ = 3` separates `Ψ₂Sq`, whose three roots are the abscissae of the
`2`-torsion and are distinct because those points are their own negatives.

Separability is insensitive to base change, so both statements descend from the algebraic closure to
an arbitrary field in which `n` is invertible.

The consequence the torsion theory wants is the last one: the minimal polynomial of the abscissa of
an `n`-torsion point is separable. `ΨSqₙ` itself need not be — it carries the factor `preΨₙ ²`,
which is repeated as soon as `preΨₙ` is not a unit — but a minimal polynomial is irreducible, so it
divides one of the two factors and inherits that factor's separability.

## Main results

* `WeierstrassCurve.separable_preΨ`: `preΨₙ` is separable when `n` is invertible.
* `WeierstrassCurve.separable_Ψ₂Sq`: `Ψ₂Sq` is separable when `2` is invertible.
* `WeierstrassCurve.separable_minpoly_of_aeval_ΨSq_eq_zero`: the minimal polynomial of a root of
  `ΨSqₙ` is separable when `n` is invertible.
* `WeierstrassCurve.separable_minpoly_of_zsmul_eq_zero`: hence so is that of the `x`-coordinate of
  an `n`-torsion point.
