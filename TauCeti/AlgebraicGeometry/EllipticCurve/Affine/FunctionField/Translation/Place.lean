# Translations move the places of points

Let `W` be an elliptic curve over a field `F`. The automorphism group of `F(W)` over `F` acts on
the places of `F(W)` (`TauCeti.Place.instMulActionAlgEquiv`), and the translation `τ_P^*` is such
an automorphism. It moves the place of a point `Q` to the place of `Q - P`: the function
`τ_P^* f` takes at `Q` the value `f` takes at `Q + P`, and the place `σ • v` is the one at which
`σ f` behaves as `f` does at `v`. Through the equivariance of principal divisors
(`TauCeti.Divisor.principal_smul`) this computes the divisor of a translated function from the
divisor of the function, which is what the divisor calculus of the Weil pairing needs.

## Main results

* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.translation_smul_pointEquivDegreeOnePlace`: `τ_P^*` carries the
  place of `Q` to the place of `Q - P`.
