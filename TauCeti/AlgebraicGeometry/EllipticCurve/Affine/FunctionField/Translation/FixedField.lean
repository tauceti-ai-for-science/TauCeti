# The fixed field of a finite group of translations

The point group of an elliptic curve `W` over `F` acts faithfully on the function field `F(W)` by
the pullbacks `τ_P^*` of the translations `τ_P : Q ↦ Q + P`. This file develops the Galois theory
of that action: a subgroup `Φ` of points gives a group `translationSubgroup` of `F`-algebra
automorphisms of `F(W)`, isomorphic to `Φ`, and the functions it fixes form the intermediate field
`translationFixedField`.

For a **finite** `Φ` the extension `F(W) / F(W) ^ Φ` is Galois of degree `#Φ`, and the
correspondence is exact: every automorphism of `F(W)` fixing `F(W) ^ Φ` is a translation by a
point of `Φ`, so `Φ` is recovered from its fixed field and distinct finite subgroups have distinct
fixed fields. Read in the other direction, an intermediate field of finite degree is fixed by only
finitely many translations, at most its degree; a subgroup of points whose fixed field has finite
degree is therefore finite, of exactly that order.

This is the field-theoretic half of the construction of the dual isogeny. That construction reads
a separable isogeny `φ : W₁ → W₂` of degree `n` after base change to a separable closure `Fˢᵉᵖ`,
over which its kernel is a subgroup `Φ` of `n` points of `W₁(Fˢᵉᵖ)`: there `Fˢᵉᵖ(W₁)` is Galois
over the pulled-back copy `φ^*Fˢᵉᵖ(W₂)` with `Φ` acting by translations, and identifying
`φ^*Fˢᵉᵖ(W₂)` as the fixed field of `Φ` is what factors `[n]` through `φ`. Over a base field that
is not separably closed the kernel of `φ` need not be `F`-rational, so the subgroup of points of
`W(F)` used below is in general smaller than that geometric kernel. The degree count and the
correspondence below are what such an identification is read off from; they are stated for an
arbitrary finite subgroup of points, no isogeny being needed to state or prove them.

## Main definitions

* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.translationSubgroup`: the group of automorphisms `τ_P^*` of `F(W)` for
  `P` in a subgroup `Φ` of the point group.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.translationFixedField`: the intermediate field of functions fixed by
  translation by every point of `Φ`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.translationFixingSubgroup`: the points whose translation fixes a given
  intermediate field pointwise.

## Main results

* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.translationMulEquiv`: the translations by `Φ` are a copy of `Φ`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.finrank_translationFixedField` and
  `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.isGalois_translationFixedField`: for a finite `Φ` the function field is
  Galois of degree `#Φ` over the fixed field.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.fixingSubgroup_translationFixedField`: the automorphisms fixing that
  field are exactly the translations by points of `Φ`, whence
  `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.translationFixingSubgroup_translationFixedField` and
  `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.eq_of_translationFixedField_eq`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.card_translationFixingSubgroup_le` and
  `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.finite_of_finiteDimensional_translationFixedField`: a degree bounds the
  translations that fix it.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.card_translationFixingSubgroup_dvd_finSepDegree`: the order of the
  subgroup fixing an intermediate field of finite degree divides the separable degree above it.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.card_translationFixingSubgroup_eq_finrank_iff`: that order is the full
  degree exactly when the subgroup cuts the field back out.
* `card_translationFixingSubgroup_eq_finrank_iff_isGalois_and_forall_exists_translation`:
  equivalently, the extension is Galois and every automorphism over the field is a translation, so
  the two conditions together are necessary as well as sufficient.
