# The place at infinity is the only place of `F(W)` where `x` has a pole

`FunctionField/InfinityPlace/Basic.lean` builds the valuation `W.infinityPlace` of the function
field of an affine Weierstrass curve and computes `v_∞ x = exp 2`, so `x` has a pole there. This
file proves the converse, and with it the uniqueness of that place: **a valuation of `F(W)` which
is trivial on `F` and gives `x` a value greater than `1` is equivalent to `W.infinityPlace`.**
Equivalence of valuations is the right conclusion — the hypothesis does not see the value group,
and a valuation is only ever determined up to equivalence by its valuation ring.

The route has three steps, and none of them needs a Riemann–Roch theorem or a normalisation.

* **On the rational functions the values are forced.** Restricting `v` along
  `F(x) → F(W)` gives a valuation of `F(x)`, trivial on `F`, with `v x > 1`; Mathlib's Ostrowski
  file evaluates such a valuation outright, `v A = (v x) ^ A.intDegree`
  (`RatFunc.valuation_eq_valuation_X_zpow_intDegree_of_one_lt_valuation_X`). So the pole order of a
  rational function is its degree, for `v` and for `v_∞` alike.
* **The Weierstrass equation fixes `v y`.** Reading `y (y + a₁x + a₃) = x³ + a₂x² + a₄x + a₆`
  through `v`, the cubic on the right has value `(v x) ^ 3` by the previous step, while the left
  factor `y + a₁x + a₃` has value `max (v y) (v x)`; a value of `y` at most `v x` would make the
  left-hand side at most `(v x) ^ 2`. Hence `v x < v y` and `(v y) ^ 2 = (v x) ^ 3`. This is the
  familiar `ord_∞ x = -2`, `ord_∞ y = -3` — but as a *consequence* of `v x > 1`, over any value
  group, so it is available before the place is known.
* **Every function is `A + B y` and the two terms never cancel.** `F(W)` is spanned by `1` and `y`
  over `F(x)`, so a function is `A + B y` with `A, B` rational. Squaring, the two values are
  `(v x) ^ (2 · deg A)` and `(v x) ^ (2 · deg B + 3)`, whose exponents differ in parity, so they
  are never equal and the valuation of the sum is the larger of the two. Hence
  `v (A + B y) ≤ 1` holds exactly when `deg A ≤ 0` and `2 · deg B + 3 ≤ 0` — a condition on two
  integers with no mention of `v`. Two valuations satisfying the hypothesis therefore have the
  same integers, so they are equivalent.

## Main results

* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.isEquiv_infinityPlace_of_one_lt`: **the uniqueness theorem** — a
  valuation of `F(W)` trivial on `F` at which `x` has a pole is equivalent to `W.infinityPlace`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.val_algebraMap_eq_zpow_intDegree` and
  `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.val_algebraMap_eq_pow_natDegree`: the value of a rational function, and
  of a polynomial, in `x`, as a power of `v x`; `val_algebraMap_le_pow` is the bound that also
  covers the zero polynomial.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.val_X_lt_val_mk_Y` and `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.val_mk_Y_sq`:
  `v x < v y` and
  `(v y) ^ 2 = (v x) ^ 3` — the pole orders `2` and `3`, for any such `v`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.val_add_mul_mk_Y`: the value of `A + B y` is the larger of the values
  of `A` and of `B y`; the two never cancel.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.val_add_mul_mk_Y_le_one_iff`: the criterion the theorem is proved by,
  worth stating because it computes the valuation ring of every such `v` in closed form.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.exists_ratFunc_add_mul_mk_Y`: every function is `A + B y` with `A` and
  `B` rational — the spanning half of the quadratic extension, in the form these arguments use.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.mk_Y_mul_add_eq`: the Weierstrass equation, read in the function field.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.one_lt_infinityPlace_X`: `1 < v_∞ x`, the instance of the hypothesis
  that `W.infinityPlace` itself satisfies.

The hypotheses are exactly `v.IsTrivialOn F` and `1 < v x`: no ellipticity, no nonsingularity, no
perfect or algebraically closed base field, and no Dedekind hypothesis on the coordinate ring. The
Weierstrass equation is the only geometry used, and it holds for singular cubics too.

## What is deliberately not here

**The affine-place classification.** The complementary case `v x ≤ 1` requires the coordinate
ring, whereas this file uses only the Weierstrass equation. The downstream file
`Affine/FunctionField/PointPlace.lean` proves that case with the generic affine-model place API,
packages the infinity valuation as `TauCeti.Place.infinity`, and combines both cases into the
point--place dictionary.

**No divisor group.** The downstream point--place file supplies a unified normalized place type
and its degree. Building divisors as finite formal sums of all such places remains separate work.

## Roadmap

`TauCetiRoadmap/EllipticCurves/README.md`, **Layer 0** (the function field, places, and divisors).
Its §Places asks for "the places of `W.FunctionField` over `K`" with `W.infinityPlace` singled out
as the one place beyond the affine ones; this is the statement that pins it down, and it is what
turns a valuation produced by some construction — the restriction of `v_∞` along an isogeny, in
`Isogeny/InfinityPlace.lean` — into *the* place at infinity. The dual-isogeny milestone of Layer 1
names that step: "an unpointed induced-place map for finite function-field embeddings, with the
named criterion `MapsInfinity λ ↔ λ_*(O₂) = O₃`".

## Provenance

Not a port, and no code from an external formalisation is copied or adapted here. The one
substantial input is Mathlib's
`RatFunc.valuation_eq_valuation_X_zpow_intDegree_of_one_lt_valuation_X` (María Inés de
Frutos-Fernández, Xavier Généreux, from the Ostrowski file for `K(X)`), which does
the rational-function half; the rest is the Weierstrass equation and the quadratic extension.
