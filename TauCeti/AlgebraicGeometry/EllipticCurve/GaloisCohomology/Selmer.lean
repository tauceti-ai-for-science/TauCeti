# The `m`-Selmer group and the Shafarevich–Tate group of an elliptic curve

Let `W` be an elliptic curve over a field `K`, with Galois cohomology taken in the discrete
`G_K`-modules `E(Kˢ)` and `E(Kˢ)[m]`. Fix a family `(L i)` of field extensions of `K`, each with a
`K`-embedding `τ i : Kˢ →ₐ[K] (L i)ˢ` of separable closures. Restriction along `τ i`
(`WeierstrassCurve.pointRes`) is the localisation map to `L i`, and Silverman's definitions read
(X.4):

```text
Ш = ker (H¹(G_K, E(Kˢ)) → ∏ᵢ H¹(G_{L i}, E((L i)ˢ))),
Sel_m = ker (H¹(G_K, E(Kˢ)[m]) → ∏ᵢ H¹(G_{L i}, E((L i)ˢ))).
```

For a number field `K` and the family of its completions at all places, these are the
Shafarevich–Tate group `Ш(E/K)` and the `m`-Selmer group `Sel_m(E/K)`. Here they are defined for
an arbitrary family, as `WeierstrassCurve.shafarevichTateGroup` and `WeierstrassCurve.selmerGroup`.
The embeddings are genuine data: restriction to `L i` is pullback along the homomorphism
`G_{L i} → G_K` that `τ i` induces, and there is no such homomorphism without a choice of
embedding.

The Selmer group is cut out by local conditions: a class lies in `Sel_m` exactly when its
restriction to each `L i` lies in the image of the local Kummer map `E(L i) → H¹(G_{L i}, E[m])`
(`WeierstrassCurve.mem_selmerGroup_iff_forall_torsionRes_mem_range_kummerMap`). This is the form
in which local conditions are checked in practice, and it follows from the compatibility of
restriction with the Kummer maps and from the local `m`-descent sequence.

The main result is the **`m`-descent sequence** (Silverman X.4.2)

```text
0 ⟶ E(K) ⧸ m E(K) ⟶ Sel_m ⟶ Ш[m] ⟶ 0,
```

obtained by restricting the global sequence `0 → E(K) ⧸ m E(K) → H¹(G_K, E[m]) → H¹(G_K, E)[m] → 0`
of `TauCeti/AlgebraicGeometry/EllipticCurve/GaloisCohomology/Descent.lean` to the Selmer group.

## Main definitions

* `WeierstrassCurve.shafarevichTateGroup`: the classes in `H¹(G_K, E(Kˢ))` that restrict to zero
  over every `L i`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.selmerGroup`: the classes in `H¹(G_K, E(Kˢ)[m])` whose image in
  `H¹(G_K, E(Kˢ))` lies in the Shafarevich–Tate group.
* `WeierstrassCurve.kummerSelmerMap`: the Kummer map `E(K) ⧸ m E(K) → Sel_m`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.selmerShaMap`: the map `Sel_m → Ш[m]`.

## Main results

* `WeierstrassCurve.mem_selmerGroup_iff_forall_torsionRes_mem_range_kummerMap`: the Selmer group
  is cut out by the images of the local Kummer maps.
* `WeierstrassCurve.kummerMap_mem_selmerGroup`: Kummer classes of points of `E(K)` are Selmer.
* `WeierstrassCurve.kummerSelmerMap_injective`,
  `WeierstrassCurve.exact_kummerSelmerMap_selmerShaMap` and
  `WeierstrassCurve.selmerShaMap_surjective`: the `m`-descent sequence
  `0 → E(K) ⧸ m E(K) → Sel_m → Ш[m] → 0` is exact.
