# The universal elliptic curve

This file defines the universal Weierstrass curve (`Universal.curve`) over the
polynomial ring `ℤ[A₁,A₂,A₃,A₄,A₆]`, and the universal pointed elliptic curve
(`Universal.pointedCurve`) over the field of fractions (`Universal.Field`) of
`Universal.Ring = Universal.Poly/⟨P⟩ = ℤ[A₁,A₂,A₃,A₄,A₆,X,Y]/⟨P⟩` (where `P` is the Weierstrass
polynomial) with distinguished point `(X,Y)`.

It also defines the universal elliptic Weierstrass curve (`Universal.ellipticCurve`) over
`Universal.EllipticRing = ℤ[A₁,A₂,A₃,A₄,A₆][Δ⁻¹]`, the polynomial ring localised away from the
discriminant `Δ` of the universal curve, and the classifying homomorphism
(`WeierstrassCurve.specializeElliptic`) along which an elliptic Weierstrass curve over any
commutative ring is the base change of that curve.

## Main definitions

* `WeierstrassCurve.Universal.curve`: the universal Weierstrass curve, over `ℤ[A₁,⋯,A₆]`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Universal.Poly`, `.Ring`, `.Field`: the polynomial ring `ℤ[A₁,⋯,A₆,X,Y]`, its
  quotient by the Weierstrass polynomial, and that quotient's field of fractions; `polyToField` is
  the composite `Poly →+* Field`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Universal.pointedCurve`: the universal curve over `Universal.Field`. It is an
  elliptic curve, and carries the distinguished point `Universal.Affine.point`
  (`Universal.Jacobian.point` in Jacobian coordinates).
* `WeierstrassCurve.specialize`: for a Weierstrass curve `W` over a commutative ring `R`, the
  specialization homomorphism `ℤ[A₁,⋯,A₆] →+* R` substituting `W`'s coefficients.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Universal.polyEval`, `.ringEval`: the homomorphism `Universal.Poly →+* R`
  induced by a point `(x,y)` of the affine plane, and its factorisation `Universal.Ring →+* R`
  through the Weierstrass polynomial when `(x,y)` lies on `W`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Universal.EllipticRing`: the ring `ℤ[A₁,⋯,A₆][Δ⁻¹]`, a Noetherian integral
  domain.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Universal.ellipticCurve`: the universal curve over `Universal.EllipticRing`. It
  is an elliptic curve.
* `WeierstrassCurve.specializeElliptic`: for an elliptic Weierstrass curve `W` over a commutative
  ring `R`, the classifying homomorphism `ℤ[A₁,⋯,A₆][Δ⁻¹] →+* R` extending `W.specialize`.

## Main results

* `WeierstrassCurve.Universal.polyToField_polynomial`: the Weierstrass polynomial vanishes in the
  universal field — the relation `Universal.Ring` is the quotient by.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Universal.equation_point`: `(X,Y)` satisfies the affine Weierstrass equation
  of `pointedCurve` — the universal curve really is pointed.
* `WeierstrassCurve.map_specialize`: every Weierstrass curve is a specialization of the universal
  one.
* `WeierstrassCurve.specialize_Δ`: `specialize` sends the discriminant of the universal curve to
  the discriminant of `W`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Universal.map_ringEval`: pushing the universal curve over
  `Universal.Ring` along `ringEval` returns `W`, so one identity **over `curveRing`** is the same
  identity for every curve and every point on it. Note the restriction: `ringEval` maps out of
  `Universal.Ring`, so it transports identities over `curveRing`, not over `pointedCurve`, which
  lives over `Universal.Field`. An identity stated there needs its denominators cleared into
  `Universal.Ring` first.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Universal.map_polyToField`: `curvePoly` pushed along `polyToField` is
  `pointedCurve`. Named rather than left definitional, because the module system does not expose
  `polyToField`'s body; this is what lands a Jacobian formula transported from `Poly` on
  `pointedCurve` rather than on an unreduced base change.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Universal.ringHom_ext`: two homomorphisms out of `Universal.Ring` agreeing on
  the coefficient ring and on the two distinguished coordinates are equal — the uniqueness half of
  the universal property, since those generate.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Universal.algebraMap_field_injective`: `ℤ[A₁,⋯,A₆]` embeds in
  `Universal.Field`, which is what makes `pointedCurve` an elliptic curve.
* `WeierstrassCurve.map_specializeElliptic`: every elliptic Weierstrass curve is the base change of
  `Universal.ellipticCurve` along its classifying homomorphism.
* `WeierstrassCurve.specializeElliptic_map_ellipticCurve`: a homomorphism out of
  `Universal.EllipticRing` is the classifying homomorphism of the curve it produces, so the
  classifying homomorphism is unique. `WeierstrassCurve.Universal.EllipticRing.ringHom_ext` is the
  extensionality behind it: the images of the five indeterminates determine the homomorphism.
* `WeierstrassCurve.specializeElliptic_map`: the classifying homomorphism is natural in the base
  ring.
* `WeierstrassCurve.exists_map_eq_of_isElliptic`: an elliptic Weierstrass curve over a commutative
  ring in `Type u` is the base change of an elliptic Weierstrass curve over a Noetherian integral
  domain in `Type u`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.exists_map_eq_and_map_eq_of_isElliptic`: the same holds for an elliptic
  Weierstrass curve together with a change of variables.

## Implementation notes

The cusp curve `Y² = X³` carries the rational point `(1,1)`, with the nice property that
`ψₙ(1,1) = n`. Specializing along it is therefore the cheap route to nonvanishing of the universal
`ψₙ` for `n ≠ 0`, which shows that `(X,Y)` is a point of infinite order on the universal pointed
elliptic curve. The `CharZero Universal.Ring` instance is the first use of that argument.

## Roadmap

The `[n]`-is-division-polynomials bullet of `TauCetiRoadmap/EllipticCurves/README.md`'s opening
narrative on isogenies asks for multiplication by `n ≠ 0` as an isogeny of degree `n²` whose
pullback is "pinned by the division-polynomial multiplication formula, already proved at the point
level in the Lutz–Nagell provenance through J. Xu's work (mathlib #13782 / `ZSMul.lean`) — the
mathlib-track anchor Layer 1 consumes". This file is the `Universal.Ring` prerequisite of that
`ZSMul.lean`: `ringEval` is what turns a single identity **over `curveRing`** into the same
identity for every Weierstrass curve and every point on it, so the point-level
`[n]`-compatibility is proved once, universally, rather than curve by curve. It maps out of
`Universal.Ring`; identities over `pointedCurve`, which is over `Universal.Field`, transport only
after their denominators are cleared into `Universal.Ring`. Mathlib PR #13782 is
still open, so the whole `Universal` namespace below is absent from Mathlib.

## Provenance

Ported from J. Xu's `LutzNagell/Universal.lean` in AINTLIB (`github.com/CBirkbeck/AINTLIB`,
Apache 2.0, `main` at `1c1c7466`, `projects/NagellLutz/LutzNagell/Universal.lean`), the source the
roadmap pins for the Nagell–Lutz strand. **Most** declarations here come from that file: the
`Coeff` index type and the bulk of the `Universal` namespace (`curve`, `Poly`, `Ring`, `Field`,
`polyToField`, `pointedCurve`, `Affine.point`, `Jacobian.point`, `curvePoly` and `curveRing` with
their lemmas), and the specialization API (`specialize`, `polyEval`, `ringEval` with their
compatibility lemmas).

Three groups are **not** simple ports, and are listed among the adaptations below: `ringHom_ext`
is new, and so is `map_polyToField` — upstream that identity is definitional and is taken as `rfl`
inside the `ZSMul.lean` proofs that need it, which this repository's unexposed `polyToField` makes
impossible; the `CharZero Universal.Ring` instance **replaces** the source's `Poly.two_ne_zero` and
`Field.two_ne_zero` rather than porting them, and carries the field case with it — Mathlib derives
`CharZero Universal.Field` from it through `IsFractionRing.charZero`, so no second instance is
declared. That derivation is why `Mathlib.Algebra.CharP.Algebra` is imported: without it
`(2 : Universal.Field) ≠ 0`, which the division-polynomial addition formulas need, does not
synthesize. And
the equation lemmas for the opaque definitions
(`polyToField_apply`, `Affine.point_def`, `Jacobian.point_def`, `pointedCurve_Δ`) exist because
this repository's module system leaves definition bodies unexposed.
That file's header reads `Authors: Junyan Xu`; following this repository's convention for adapted
material, the upstream authorship is credited here rather than in the copyright header.

Four adaptations were made. The file was converted to this repository's module system (`module`,
`public import`, `public section`). The source's three opening lemmas —
`CoordinateRing.algebraMap_poly_injective`, `CoordinateRing.algebraMap_injective'` and
`Affine.Point.some_eq_some_iff` — are **not** ported: the first two are
`FaithfulSMul.algebraMap_injective` applied to Mathlib's own `FaithfulSMul` instances on the
coordinate ring, and the third is the `Iff` reading of the auto-generated `some.injEq`, which `simp`
proves alone. This repository declines such wrappers, and had already declined the analogous
instances in `Affine/FunctionField/Finrank.lean`; the one internal use, in
`algebraMap_field_injective`, calls `FaithfulSMul.algebraMap_injective` directly. Dropping them also
removes the source's `set_option backward.isDefEq.respectTransparency false in`, which existed only
for the first of them and which `TauCeti/` forbids in any case.
No definition in this file is exposed. `polyToField_apply`, `algebraMap_field_eq_comp`, the five
`pointedCurve_aᵢ` lemmas and the two `point_def` lemmas are proved `:= (rfl)`: the parentheses
satisfy the module system's export check without publishing any body, which is what an `@[expose]`
would do. The section is a plain `public section` for the reason spelled out in
`TauCeti/AlgebraicGeometry/EllipticCurve/Affine/Point/VariableChange.lean` — exposing the whole file
would publish every proof body to make a handful of `rfl`s go through. And `equation_point` opens
with `change` where the source has `show`, that step rewriting the goal rather than only naming it
(`linter.style.show`).

`polyToField_polynomial` is the source's declaration of that name (its `:120`), and the last of
this file's declarations to arrive; `equation_point`, which the source also routes through it,
does so here too. One difference: upstream it is `@[simp]`, and here it must not be. `simp` can
already prove the statement, because this file's `polyToField_apply` is `@[simp]` where the
source's is not, and the tag therefore fails `scripts/lint-env.sh` with a fresh
`simpNF` violation (*"simp can prove this: by simp only [\*, polyToField_apply, AdjoinRoot.mk_self,
map_zero]"*). Untagged, that run reports no new violations. Being redundant for `simp` does not
make the name redundant: three proofs cite it by name, `equation_point` here and the two doubling
formulas in `DivisionPolynomial/ZSMul.lean`.

The section on the universal elliptic Weierstrass curve has a second source: the ModularCurves
project of AINTLIB (`github.com/CBirkbeck/AINTLIB`, Apache 2.0, commit
`c3415f32a313e19ace43e05479aeaa0d56ca287a`, under `projects/ModularCurves/ModularCurves/`). Adapted
from it are `WeierstrassAtlasRing` with its `IsDomain` and `IsNoetherianRing` instances and
`universalWeierstrassLoc` with its `IsElliptic` instance (`Moduli/WeierstrassAtlas.lean`),
`classifyRingHom` and `universalWeierstrassLoc_map_classifyRingHom`
(`EllipticCurve/WeierstrassAtlasBundle.lean`), `classifyRingHom_map` and
`classifyRingHom_universalWeierstrassLoc` (`EllipticCurve/AdditionBaseChange.lean`), and
`ringHomOfEllipticW_ellipticWOfRingHom` (`Moduli/MellWeierstrass.lean`). Those headers read
`Authors: Chris Birkbeck`, except that of `WeierstrassAtlasBundle.lean`, which reads
`Authors: The AINTLIB Authors`.

The source builds these on a second universal curve, `universalWeierstrass` over
`MvPolynomial (Fin 5) ℤ`, with its own coefficient maps `classifyCoeffHom` and `specializeAt`. Here
they are built on this file's `Universal.curve` and `specialize`, so there is one universal curve
and `specializeElliptic` extends `specialize`. `EllipticRing.ringHom_ext` is new: the source repeats
`IsLocalization.ringHom_ext` and `MvPolynomial.ringHom_ext` inside each proof.
`specializeElliptic_map` and `specializeElliptic_ellipticCurve` are corollaries of
`specializeElliptic_map_ellipticCurve` rather than separate computations, and
`specializeElliptic_map` takes the ellipticity of `W.map f` from Mathlib's instance instead of a
second hypothesis. The Noetherian instance is not declared: instance search derives it from
Mathlib's instances once `Coeff` is a `Fintype`. The source's `ULift` copies in higher universes
(`WeierstrassAtlasRingU`, `universalWeierstrassLocU` and `classifyRingHomU`, in
`EllipticCurve/AdditionBaseChange.lean`) are not ported as declarations. In their place,
`exists_map_eq_of_isElliptic` states only that such a ring, curve and homomorphism exist. It is
adapted from those three, from the `IsDomain` instance on `WeierstrassAtlasRingU` and
`universalWeierstrassLocU_map_classifyRingHomU` (same file), and from the `IsNoetherianRing`
instance on `WeierstrassAtlasRingU` (`EllipticCurve/GroupLawAxioms.lean`, whose header reads
`Authors: The AINTLIB Authors`).
