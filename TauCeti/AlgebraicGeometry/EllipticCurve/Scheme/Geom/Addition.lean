# The addition morphism of an elliptic curve over a scheme

Let `E` be an elliptic curve over a scheme `S`, with structure morphism `π : E ⟶ S` and zero
section `0`. Zariski-locally on `S`, `E` is the projective model of an elliptic Weierstrass curve,
through a pointed Weierstrass chart; the projective model carries the Bosma–Lenstra addition
morphism `WeierstrassCurve.additionMorphism`. This file glues these local addition morphisms to the
addition morphism `E ×_S E ⟶ E` over `S`.

A pointed Weierstrass chart `c`, over an open `U = base ⟶ S`, presents the restriction `E_U` of
`E` as the projective model of its equation. Transporting the addition morphism of the equation
along this presentation gives the **addition of the chart** `E_U ×_U E_U ⟶ E_U`
(`PointedWeierstrassChart.addition`). The additions of two charts agree where both are defined.
Over an affine open `V` of the base of a chart `c`, the restriction `c.restrict V` is again a
chart, and the comparison of the two charts over `V` is a morphism of projective models which
carries the zero section to the zero section and is a base change square. The Bosma–Lenstra
addition morphism commutes with such morphisms
(`WeierstrassCurve.additionMorphism_comp_of_isPullback`), because a pointed isomorphism of
projective models over an affine base is induced by a change of variables. So the addition of
every chart restricts to the addition of each of its restrictions to affine opens, and two charts
`c` and `d` agree near every point of `U_c ∩ U_d`, through a restriction of `c` to an affine open
mapping into `U_d`.

The parts `E_U ×_U E_U` of `E ×_S E` over the bases of all pointed Weierstrass charts form an open
cover, and the additions of the charts glue along it (`EllipticCurveGeom.glueMorphisms`) to
`EllipticCurveGeom.addition`. Its
restriction to every chart is the addition of the chart (`EllipticCurveGeom.pullbackMap_addition`),
and this characterises it among all morphisms `E ×_S E ⟶ E`, already on the charts of any one atlas
(`EllipticCurveGeom.eq_addition_of_atlas`). In particular the addition morphism does not depend on
the choice of local Weierstrass equations.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.PointedWeierstrassChart.addition c`: the addition of a pointed
  Weierstrass chart, the Bosma–Lenstra addition morphism of its equation transported to the
  restriction of the curve to the base of the chart.
* `TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.EllipticCurveGeom.addition E`: the addition morphism `E ×_S E ⟶ E` of
  an elliptic curve over a scheme.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.PointedWeierstrassChart.addition_pullbackCarrierMap`: the addition of
  a chart restricts, over a chart whose base maps into its base, to the addition of that chart.
* `TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.EllipticCurveGeom.pullbackMap_addition`: on the restriction of
  `E ×_S E` to the base of any pointed Weierstrass chart, the addition morphism is the addition of
  the chart.
* `TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.EllipticCurveGeom.addition_structureMap`: the addition morphism lies
  over `S`.
* `TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.EllipticCurveGeom.eq_addition_of_atlas`: a morphism `E ×_S E ⟶ E`
  that restricts to the addition of every chart of a pointed Weierstrass atlas is the addition
  morphism.
