# The group law of an elliptic curve over a scheme

Let `E` be an elliptic curve over a scheme `S`, with structure morphism `π : E ⟶ S`, and regard `E`
as the object `Over.mk π` of the cartesian monoidal category `Over S`, whose tensor product is the
fibre product over `S`. This file makes `E` a commutative group object of `Over S`: a commutative
group scheme over `S`. The unit is the zero section, the multiplication is the addition morphism
`E ×_S E ⟶ E` (`EllipticCurveGeom.addition`) and the inverse is the negation morphism `E ⟶ E`
(`EllipticCurveGeom.neg`), both glued from the Bosma–Lenstra formulae of the local Weierstrass
equations of `E`.

The group axioms are local on `S`, and over the base `U` of a pointed Weierstrass chart they are
the group axioms of the projective model of the equation of the chart
(`WeierstrassCurve.grpObjProjModel`). The argument is carried out on points. For `T` over `S`, the
morphisms `T ⟶ E` over `S` form a commutative group, with the sum of `x` and `y` the composite of
`(x, y) : T ⟶ E ×_S E` with the addition morphism. Restricting `T` to the base of a chart and
reading points of `E` there as points of the projective model of the equation of the chart is
injective jointly over all charts and carries the sum, the zero and the negation of points to those
of the projective model, so the group axioms for points of `E` follow from those for points of the
projective model. These groups are natural in `T`, so `E` represents a presheaf of commutative
groups on `Over S`, and is therefore a commutative group object
(`CategoryTheory.CommGrpObj.ofRepresentableBy`).

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.EllipticCurveGeom.grpObj`: the group-object structure on
  `Over.mk E.structureMap`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.EllipticCurveGeom.isCommMonObj`: the group law is commutative.
* `TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.EllipticCurveGeom.one_left`,
  `TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.EllipticCurveGeom.mul_left` and
  `TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.EllipticCurveGeom.inv_left`: the unit, multiplication and inverse are
  the zero section, the addition morphism and the negation morphism.
* `TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.EllipticCurveGeom.hom_one_left`,
  `TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.EllipticCurveGeom.hom_mul_left` and
  `TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.EllipticCurveGeom.hom_inv_left`: in the group of points of `E` with
  values in an object of `Over S`, the zero, the product and the inverse are the zero section, the
  sum under the addition morphism and the negation.
