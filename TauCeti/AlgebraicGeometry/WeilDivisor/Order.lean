# The order on Weil divisors and the positive/negative part decomposition

This file continues the Jacobian roadmap's Layer A formal Weil divisor API
(`TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.WeilDivisor.Basic`) by recording the lattice-ordered-group structure of
formal divisors and the canonical decomposition of a divisor into its effective positive and
negative parts.

The point set `X →₀ ℤ` already carries the coefficientwise partial order, the lattice
operations `⊔`/`⊓`, and (because `ℤ` is an ordered group) the lattice-ordered-group positive and
negative parts `D⁺` and `D⁻` from Mathlib. The contribution here is to connect that order with
the divisor vocabulary already in place: effectivity is nonnegativity, `D ≤ E` is effectivity of
`E - D`, the pointwise maximum and minimum of effective divisors are effective, and every
divisor decomposes as `D = D⁺ - D⁻` with `D⁺`, `D⁻` effective of disjoint support. We read off
the consequences for the unweighted and weighted degree maps and compute the decomposition of
the basic degree-zero divisors `[x] - [y]`.

This reuses Mathlib's lattice-ordered-group `posPart`/`negPart` API
(`Mathlib.Algebra.Order.Group.PosPart`) and the coefficientwise order and lattice on finitely
supported functions (`Mathlib.Order.Preorder.Finsupp`, `Mathlib.Data.Finsupp.Order`); no
external mathematics is vendored.

This advances the Tau Ceti Jacobian roadmap, Layer A, "Divisors on a curve: Weil divisors
`⊕_x ℤ`", "principal divisors", and "Degree".
