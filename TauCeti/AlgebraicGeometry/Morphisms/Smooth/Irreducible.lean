# Connected smooth schemes over a regular base are irreducible

A connected scheme that is smooth over a locally Noetherian scheme with regular local rings is
irreducible. In particular a connected scheme smooth over a field is irreducible, and so is the
base change to `AlgebraicClosure K` of a smooth `K`-scheme whenever that base change is connected.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.Smooth.irreducibleSpace_of_connectedSpace`: a connected scheme smooth
  over a locally Noetherian scheme with regular local rings is irreducible.
* `TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.Smooth.irreducibleSpace_baseChange_algebraicClosure_of_connectedSpace`:
  for a smooth morphism `X ⟶ Spec K`, the base change of `X` to `AlgebraicClosure K` is
  irreducible if it is connected.

## Provenance

The statements generalise two from AINTLIB (`github.com/CBirkbeck/AINTLIB`, Apache-2.0) at commit
`c3415f32a313e19ace43e05479aeaa0d56ca287a`:
`ModularCurves.irreducibleSpace_of_connectedSpace_of_smooth_curve` in
`projects/ModularCurves/ModularCurves/ForMathlib/SmoothSchemeIrreducible.lean`, for schemes smooth
of relative dimension one over an algebraically closed field, and
`ModularCurves.yRho_geometricallyIrreducible_of_connected'` in
`projects/ModularCurves/ModularCurves/ModularCurve/IrreducibilityScoping.lean`, for the base change
to `AlgebraicClosure ℚ` of a `ℚ`-scheme representing the `ρ`-level moduli problem, a hypothesis
that includes smoothness of relative dimension one. The source proves the first from irreducible
open neighbourhoods in standard smooth charts; the proof here uses the regularity of the local
rings.
