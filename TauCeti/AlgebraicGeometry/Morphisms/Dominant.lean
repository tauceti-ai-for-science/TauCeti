# Dominant morphisms of irreducible schemes and rational functions

A morphism `f : X ⟶ Y` of schemes is dominant (`AlgebraicGeometry.IsDominant`) when its image is
dense. Between irreducible schemes this says exactly that `f` sends the generic point of `X` to the
generic point of `Y`. The map of stalks at the generic point is then a homomorphism
`f^* : K(Y) ⟶ K(X)` of function fields, the pullback of rational functions along `f`. It is the
homomorphism through which `f` acts on the generic point: the canonical morphism
`Spec K(X) ⟶ X` followed by `f` is `Spec f^*` followed by the canonical morphism
`Spec K(Y) ⟶ Y`, and `f^*` is the only homomorphism with this property.

This is how a dominant morphism of integral curves is compared with a homomorphism of function
fields given by other means, for instance by explicit formulae: it suffices to compute the image of
the generic point.

## Main definitions

* `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Hom.functionFieldMap`: the pullback `K(Y) ⟶ K(X)` of rational
  functions along a dominant morphism `f : X ⟶ Y` of irreducible schemes.

## Main results

* `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Hom.genericPoint_eq_of_isDominant`: a dominant morphism of
  irreducible schemes sends the generic point to the generic point.
* `AlgebraicGeometry.isDominant_iff_genericPoint_eq`: conversely, a morphism of irreducible
  schemes sending the generic point to the generic point is dominant.
* `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Hom.isDominant_of_SpecMap_fromSpecStalk`: a morphism of irreducible
  schemes whose action on the generic point is given by a local homomorphism of function fields is
  dominant.
* `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Hom.SpecMap_functionFieldMap_fromSpecStalk`: `Spec f^*` followed by
  `Spec K(Y) ⟶ Y` is `Spec K(X) ⟶ X` followed by `f`.
* `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Hom.eq_functionFieldMap_iff`: `f^*` is the only homomorphism of
  function fields with this property.
* `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Hom.germToFunctionField_functionFieldMap`: `f^*` sends the germ of a
  section `s` over an open `U` to the germ of its pullback `f^* s` over `f⁻¹ U`.
* `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Hom.functionFieldMap_id` and
  `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Hom.functionFieldMap_comp`: functoriality.
