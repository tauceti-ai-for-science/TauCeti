# Approximation by measurable rectangles

Every measurable subset of a product measurable space equipped with a finite measure can be
approximated in measure by a finite disjoint union of measurable rectangles.  The statement is
valid for arbitrary measurable spaces: no countable-generation or standard-Borel hypothesis is
needed.

This is the set-level approximation used in the finite-step reduction for the coupling triangle
inequality of graphon cut distance.  A bounded measurable kernel is first approximated by a simple
function; the result here is then applied to its finitely many level sets to construct an
approximating simple function depending on only finitely many measurable events in each coordinate.

The proof applies Mathlib's general density theorem
`exists_measure_symmDiff_lt_of_generateFrom_isSetSemiring` to the semiring of measurable
rectangles.  We verify the semiring law explicitly: the difference of two rectangles splits into
two disjoint rectangles.  `generateFrom_prod` supplies the generation of the product sigma algebra.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.MeasureTheory.exists_finset_prod_measure_symmDiff_lt` approximates a product-measurable
  set by a pairwise-disjoint finite family of measurable rectangles.
* `TauCeti.MeasureTheory.exists_finset_prod_symmetric_measure_symmDiff_lt` does so while preserving
  invariance under swapping the two coordinates.

/-- A measurable subset of a product measurable space with a finite measure can be approximated in
measure by a pairwise-disjoint finite union of measurable rectangles.

The output family contains no empty set, because it is the family of parts of a `Finpartition`.
The conclusion uses `⋃₀ (I : Set (Set (X × Y)))` rather than an indexed union so callers may retain
the finite family itself and refine all of its coordinate sides at once. -/

/-- A swap-invariant measurable subset of the square of a finite measure space can be approximated
by a swap-invariant, pairwise-disjoint finite union of measurable rectangles.

Starting from `exists_finset_prod_measure_symmDiff_lt`, take the union of the approximant and its
coordinate swap.  This at most doubles the error.  The resulting finite union is repartitioned into
disjoint rectangles using the same rectangle semiring, so symmetry does not cost the useful
pairwise-disjoint output contract. -/
