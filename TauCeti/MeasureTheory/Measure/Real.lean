# Elementary real-measure identities and the squaring map

This file records elementary identities about measures on the real line. In particular, squaring
loses the sign of a real number and nothing else, so it determines a measure on the line as soon as
the measure cannot tell the two signs apart. For a reflection-invariant finite measure, the
pushforward under squaring is a complete invariant: the square records the mass of intervals
symmetric about zero, while reflection invariance makes the two complementary tails equal. For a
measure carried by the nonnegative half-line, squaring is undone by `Real.sqrt`, so the pushforward
determines the measure outright.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.volume_Ioc_inter_Ioo_zero_one` — the portion of an interval in the open unit interval;
* `MeasureTheory.Measure.eq_of_map_sq_eq_of_map_neg_eq_self` — two symmetric finite real
  measures with the same pushforward after squaring are equal.
* `MeasureTheory.Measure.map_sqrt_map_sq` — on the nonnegative half-line, taking square roots
  undoes squaring.
