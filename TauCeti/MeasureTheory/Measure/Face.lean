# Measures vanishing on a set form a face

Among the measures in any set `C` of measures, those giving mass zero to a fixed set `t` form a
face of `C`: a convex combination with positive weights vanishes on `t` only when both of its ends
do. Mathlib's `IsExtreme.extremePoints_eq` then reads the extreme points of the face off those of
`C`, which is how extremality among the laws carried by a set (vanishing on its complement)
reduces to extremality among all of `C`. When `C` is convex so is the face.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.MeasureTheory.isExtreme_setOf_measure_eq_zero` — the measures in `C` vanishing on `t`
  are a face of `C`.
* `TauCeti.MeasureTheory.extremePoints_setOf_measure_eq_zero` — their extreme points are the
  extreme points of `C` vanishing on `t`.
* `TauCeti.MeasureTheory.Convex.setOf_measure_eq_zero` — the face of a convex set is convex.
