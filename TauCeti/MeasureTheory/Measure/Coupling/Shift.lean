# The shift coupling of two weightings of a finite carrier

Two measures of equal finite total mass on a finite carrier that differ by a transfer of weight
onto one designated atom `k₀` -- so that `ν'` is dominated by `ν` everywhere else -- are coupled
here by keeping the matched mass `min (ν {k}) (ν' {k})` at `(k, k)` and putting the excess
`ν {k} - ν' {k}` at `(k, k₀)`.  The mass this places off the diagonal is then at most the
transferred weight, which is what a cost estimate against the diagonal consumes.

Mathlib has no maximal-coupling construction, and the general one is not needed here: dominance away
from a single atom already says where the unmatched mass can go.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.MeasureTheory.shiftCoupling` -- the coupling described above.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.MeasureTheory.shiftCoupling_apply` -- its value on an arbitrary set;
* `TauCeti.MeasureTheory.shiftCoupling_compl_diagonal_le_sum_tsub` -- it puts at most the
  transferred mass off the diagonal;
* `TauCeti.MeasureTheory.isCoupling_shiftCoupling` -- it is a coupling of `ν` and `ν'`.

## References

* `TauCeti/Data/ENNReal/Weights.lean` -- the arithmetic of the two weightings the marginals are
  computed from.

/-- The coupling of two weight vectors on a finite carrier that keeps as much mass as possible on
the diagonal and transfers the excess of every other atom to the designated atom `k₀`.

It couples `ν` and `ν'` when their total singleton masses are equal and finite and `ν'` is dominated
by `ν` away from `k₀` (`isCoupling_shiftCoupling`), and the mass it puts off the diagonal is then
bounded by the total transferred weight (`shiftCoupling_compl_diagonal_le_sum_tsub`). -/

/-- **The shift coupling is a coupling.**  For measures with equal finite total singleton mass, its
first marginal is `ν` because the matched mass and the excess add up at every atom, and its second
marginal is `ν'` because the designated atom `k₀` absorbs exactly the total excess. -/
