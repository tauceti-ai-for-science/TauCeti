# Ergodic group actions and extreme invariant measures

For a countable group `G` acting measurably on `X`, an invariant measure of finite total mass is
ergodic if and only if it is an extreme point of the `G`-invariant measures of that total mass;
in particular an invariant probability measure is ergodic if and only if it is an extreme point of
the invariant measures of total mass one. This is the group-action form of Mathlib's
`Ergodic.iff_mem_extremePoints`, which concerns a single measure-preserving map.

Two general facts about an ergodic action carry the characterisation and are useful on their
own: an almost invariant function is almost everywhere constant
(`ErgodicSMul.ae_eq_const_of_forall_ae_eq_comp_smul₀`), and an invariant measure absolutely
continuous with respect to an ergodic one is a multiple of it
(`ErgodicSMul.eq_smul_of_absolutelyContinuous`). These, the invariant-measure set and the
forward direction of the characterisation need only an action by a type with a scalar
multiplication; the group and its countability enter only in the reverse direction, through the
saturation of an almost invariant event in `CountableAction.lean`.

Extremality also has an integral form: an ergodic probability measure written as a mixture
`κ ∘ₘ π` of almost surely invariant probability measures has almost every component equal to
itself (`ErgodicSMul.ae_eq_of_comp_eq`). This is what removes a global randomization parameter
from a functional representation of an ergodic law.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.MeasureTheory.invariantMeasuresOfMeasureUnivEq`, with its membership and convexity
  lemmas; the invariant probability measures are the case of total mass one
* `ErgodicSMul.ae_eq_const_of_forall_ae_eq_comp_smul₀`
* `ErgodicSMul.eq_smul_of_absolutelyContinuous`,
  `ErgodicSMul.eq_of_absolutelyContinuous_measure_univ_eq`, `ErgodicSMul.eq_of_absolutelyContinuous`
* `ErgodicSMul.iff_mem_extremePoints_measure_univ_eq`, `ErgodicSMul.iff_mem_extremePoints`
* `TauCeti.MeasureTheory.smulInvariantMeasure_comp`, `ErgodicSMul.ae_eq_of_comp_eq`: a mixture of
  invariant measures is invariant, and an ergodic probability measure written as such a mixture
  has almost every component equal to itself

## References

The proofs of `eq_smul_of_absolutelyContinuous`, `eq_of_absolutelyContinuous_measure_univ_eq`,
`mem_extremePoints_measure_univ_eq` and `of_mem_extremePoints_measure_univ_eq` are adapted from
Mathlib's `Mathlib/Dynamics/Ergodic/Extreme.lean` by Yury Kudryashov, transposed from a single
measure-preserving map to an action; `ae_eq_const_of_forall_ae_eq_comp_smul₀` follows
`PreErgodic.ae_eq_const_of_ae_eq_comp` in `Mathlib/Dynamics/Ergodic/Function.lean`. The same
argument for the sortwise relabelling action on relational structures appears in
`Graphon/RelErgodicExtreme.lean` of `cameronfreer/graphon` (Apache 2.0) at commit
`18d47ebb4155d32031090ec3412eb71583a94f69`.
