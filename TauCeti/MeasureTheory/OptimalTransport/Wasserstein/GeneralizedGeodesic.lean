# Generalized geodesics in the Wasserstein space

The squared quadratic Wasserstein distance `ν ↦ W₂ (μ, ν) ^ 2` from a fixed law `μ` is in general
not convex along the Wasserstein geodesics of `ℝ²`; along them it satisfies the reverse,
semiconcavity inequality instead. It is, however, convex along a different family of curves
joining two laws `ν₀` and `ν₁`, the
*generalized geodesics based at `μ`*. These are built from a single measure `γ` on `X × X × X`,
read as the joint law of a triple `(x, y₀, y₁)`, whose projection to `(x, y₀)` is an optimal
coupling of `μ` and `ν₀` and whose projection to `(x, y₁)` is an optimal coupling of `μ` and `ν₁`
(`TauCeti.IsGeneralizedGeodesicPlan`). Such a three-plan exists on every Polish metric space, by
gluing two optimal couplings along their common first marginal
(`TauCeti.exists_isGeneralizedGeodesicPlan`). In a real inner product space the generalized
geodesic of `γ` is the curve of laws of `(1 - t) • y₀ + t • y₁` under `γ`
(`TauCeti.generalizedGeodesic`), which runs from `ν₀` at `t = 0` to `ν₁` at `t = 1`.

Along it, for `t ∈ [0, 1]`,

`W₂ (μ, ν_t) ^ 2 + t (1 - t) ∫ ‖y₀ - y₁‖ ^ 2 dγ ≤ (1 - t) W₂ (μ, ν₀) ^ 2 + t W₂ (μ, ν₁) ^ 2`,

and since `γ` projects to a coupling of `ν₀` and `ν₁`, the integral may be replaced by the smaller
`W₂ (ν₀, ν₁) ^ 2`: the function `ν ↦ W₂ (μ, ν) ^ 2 / 2` is `1`-convex along generalized geodesics
based at `μ`. The reason is the pointwise Hilbert identity
`‖x - ((1 - t) a + t b)‖ ^ 2 + t (1 - t) ‖a - b‖ ^ 2 = (1 - t) ‖x - a‖ ^ 2 + t ‖x - b‖ ^ 2`
(`TauCeti.edist_smul_add_smul_sq_add`), integrated against `γ`, together with the coupling of `μ`
and `ν_t` that `γ` provides. All statements are inequalities in `[0, ∞]` and need no moment
hypotheses.

This convexity is the estimate on which the theory of minimizing movements in the quadratic
Wasserstein space rests: for an energy that is `λ`-convex along the generalized geodesics based at
the previous step, it makes the penalized functional of an implicit Euler step of size `τ`
`(λ + 1 / τ)`-convex along them, hence strictly convex when `λ + 1 / τ > 0`, which is what yields
uniqueness of the step and the discrete energy estimates.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.IsGeneralizedGeodesicPlan p γ μ ν₀ ν₁`: the measure `γ` on `X × X × X` projects to
  `p`-optimal couplings of `μ` with `ν₀` and of `μ` with `ν₁`.
* `TauCeti.generalizedGeodesic γ t`: the law of `(1 - t) • y₀ + t • y₁` under `γ`.

## Main statements

* `TauCeti.exists_isGeneralizedGeodesicPlan`: on a Polish metric space, every finite base measure
  `μ` and two measures coupled with it carry such a three-plan, for every nonzero exponent.
* `TauCeti.IsGeneralizedGeodesicPlan.generalizedGeodesic_zero` and
  `TauCeti.IsGeneralizedGeodesicPlan.generalizedGeodesic_one`: the generalized geodesic runs from
  `ν₀` to `ν₁`.
* `TauCeti.wassersteinEDist_generalizedGeodesic_sq_add_le`: the convexity inequality for an
  arbitrary three-plan with first marginal `μ`, against the three transport integrals of the plan.
* `TauCeti.IsGeneralizedGeodesicPlan.wassersteinEDist_sq_add_le` and
  `TauCeti.IsGeneralizedGeodesicPlan.wassersteinEDist_sq_add_wassersteinEDist_sq_le`: the
  convexity of `ν ↦ W₂ (μ, ν) ^ 2` along generalized geodesics based at `μ`.
