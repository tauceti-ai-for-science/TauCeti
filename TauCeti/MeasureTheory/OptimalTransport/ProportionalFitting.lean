# Iterative proportional fitting

Iterative proportional fitting (IPF), the measure-theoretic form of the Sinkhorn iteration,
approaches the static Schrödinger problem `inf {klDiv π R | π couples μ and ν}` by alternately
enforcing the two marginal constraints. Starting from the reference measure `R` on `X × Y`, each
sweep first reweights the current measure along the first coordinate towards first marginal `μ`,
and then along the second coordinate towards second marginal `ν`. Each half-step is
`MeasureTheory.Measure.fitLaw`; it makes the corresponding marginal equal to its target exactly
when that target is absolutely continuous with respect to the current marginal, and is then the
relative-entropy projection onto the measures with that prescribed marginal.

For every coupling `σ` of `μ` and `ν`, the Pythagorean identity of these projections telescopes:
after `n` sweeps,
`klDiv σ R = ∑_{k < n} (klDiv μ (π_k).fst + klDiv ν (π_k').snd) + klDiv σ π_n`,
where `π_k` is the `k`-th iterate and `π_k'` the measure halfway through the next sweep. The terms
of the sum are the marginal errors of the iteration, measured in relative entropy. Minimising over
`σ`, their total is at most the Schrödinger value. So, as soon as some coupling has finite relative
entropy with respect to `R`, the marginal errors are summable and tend to `0`. Such a coupling also
has finite relative entropy against every iterate and every half-step, so each target marginal is
absolutely continuous with respect to the current one, and every half-step enforces its marginal
exactly. Nothing beyond the measurable structure of `X` and `Y` is used.

## Main definitions

* `MeasureTheory.Measure.proportionalFittingStep π μ ν`: one sweep, fitting the first marginal
  to `μ` and then the second marginal to `ν`.
* `MeasureTheory.Measure.proportionalFitting R μ ν n`: the `n`-th iterate of the sweep, started
  at `R`.

## Main statements

* `TauCeti.klDiv_eq_add_klDiv_proportionalFittingStep`: the Pythagorean identity of one sweep.
* `TauCeti.klDiv_eq_sum_add_klDiv_proportionalFitting`: its telescoped form after `n` sweeps.
* `TauCeti.tsum_klDiv_le_schroedingerValue`: the total marginal error is at most the Schrödinger
  value.
* `TauCeti.tendsto_klDiv_fst_proportionalFitting` and
  `TauCeti.tendsto_klDiv_snd_fitLaw_proportionalFitting`: under finite-entropy feasibility, the
  marginal errors tend to `0`.
* `TauCeti.fst_fitLaw_proportionalFitting` and
  `TauCeti.snd_proportionalFittingStep_proportionalFitting`: under finite-entropy feasibility, each
  half-step enforces its marginal exactly.
