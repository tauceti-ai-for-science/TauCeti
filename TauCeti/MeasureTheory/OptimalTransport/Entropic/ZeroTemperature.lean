# The zero-temperature limit of entropic optimal transport

As the temperature `ε` decreases to `0`, the entropically regularised transport cost
`TauCeti.entropicTransportCost c ε μ ν`, the infimum of `∫⁻ c dπ + ε * klDiv π (μ ⊗ ν)` over the
couplings `π` of `μ` and `ν`, decreases. This file identifies its limit and shows that limits of
entropic optimizers are optimal transport plans.

The limit is always the infimum of `∫⁻ c dπ` over the couplings `π` of **finite** relative entropy
with respect to `μ ⊗ ν`. This holds with no hypothesis on the cost or the spaces; it can be
strictly larger than the transport cost, for instance for two copies of the uniform law on
`[0, 1]` and the cost `0` on the diagonal and `∞` off it, where the only coupling of finite cost is
the diagonal one, which is singular with respect to `μ ⊗ ν`.

The limit is the transport cost as soon as the cost can be discretised: if for every `η > 0` there
are finite measurable partitions of `X` and `Y` such that `c` varies by at most `η` on each product
cell, then every coupling `π` is approximated by a coupling of finite relative entropy that costs
at most `η` per unit of mass more. That coupling is the *block approximation* of `π`: on each
product cell `A × B` it has the mass `π (A × B)`, spread proportionally to `μ ⊗ ν`. It is the
relative-entropy projection `(μ.prod ν).fitLaw Q (π.map Q)` of `μ ⊗ ν` onto the measures with the
same cell masses as `π`, where `Q` sends a point to its cell, so its relative entropy is that of a
discrete law on finitely many cells. A uniformly continuous real cost on totally bounded
pseudometric spaces, and in particular a continuous one on compact spaces, can be discretised.

## Main statements

* `TauCeti.IsCoupling.isCoupling_fitLaw_prodMap`: the projection of `μ ⊗ ν` onto the measures with
  the cell masses of a coupling `π`, along product maps `p` and `q`, is again a coupling of `μ` and
  `ν`.
* `TauCeti.IsCoupling.exists_isCoupling_klDiv_ne_top_map_prodMap_eq`: for measurable maps to
  finite types, every coupling has the cell masses of a coupling of finite relative entropy.
* `TauCeti.IsCoupling.exists_isCoupling_klDiv_ne_top_lintegral_le`: if the cost varies by at most
  `η` on every cell, that coupling costs at most `η * μ univ` more.
* `TauCeti.iInf_entropicTransportCost` and `TauCeti.tendsto_entropicTransportCost_nhdsGT_zero`: as
  `ε → 0⁺`, the regularised cost decreases to the infimum of the costs of the couplings of finite
  relative entropy.
* `TauCeti.tendsto_entropicTransportCost_transportCost`: for a cost that can be discretised, the
  limit is the transport cost;
  `TauCeti.tendsto_entropicTransportCost_transportCost_of_uniformContinuous` and
  `TauCeti.tendsto_entropicTransportCost_transportCost_of_continuous` are the totally bounded and
  compact cases.
* `TauCeti.isOptimalCoupling_of_tendsto_of_entropicTransportCost`: when the values converge to the
  transport cost and the cost is lower semicontinuous, every weak limit of entropic optimizers at
  temperatures `ε → 0⁺` is an optimal transport plan.

/-- **The block approximation is a coupling.** Let `π` couple measures `μ` and `ν`, and let `p`
and `q` be measurable maps to the cell labels along which `μ` and `ν` push forward to σ-finite
measures (for instance, `μ` and `ν` finite). If the cell masses of `π` are absolutely
continuous with respect to those of `μ ⊗ ν`, the relative-entropy projection of `μ ⊗ ν` onto the
measures with the cell masses of `π` is again a coupling of `μ` and `ν`. On each cell it is
`μ ⊗ ν` rescaled to the mass that `π` gives the cell. -/
