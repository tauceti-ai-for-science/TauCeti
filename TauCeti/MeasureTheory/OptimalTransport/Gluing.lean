# Gluing transport plans

Two transport plans that share an intermediate marginal can be realised simultaneously: if `π` is a
measure on `X × Y` whose second marginal agrees with the first marginal of a measure `σ` on
`Y × Z`, then there is a measure `γ` on `X × Y × Z` whose `(X, Y)`-marginal is `π` and whose
`(Y, Z)`-marginal is `σ`. This is the gluing lemma, and it is what lets transport costs be composed
— it is the measure-theoretic input to the triangle inequality for Wasserstein distances and to
the composition of couplings.

The construction is a composition-product against a conditional kernel, so it needs a
disintegration of one of the two plans. There are two ways to obtain one. Mathlib's regular
conditional kernel gives it under a standard Borel hypothesis on one of the two *outer* spaces,
the middle space `Y` then carrying no hypothesis at all. Alternatively, when the *middle* space is
countable with measurable singletons, `TauCeti.MeasureTheory.countableCondKernel` gives it with no
hypothesis on either outer space — the regime the cut distance of the dense graph limit theory
needs, since its two carriers are arbitrary probability spaces.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.Measure.glue π κ` — the measure on `X × Y × Z` obtained by extending a measure
  `π : Measure (X × Y)` along a kernel `κ : Kernel Y Z` acting on the middle coordinate. It is the
  associated right-nested form of `π ⊗ₘ Kernel.prodMkLeft X κ`.

## Main statements

* `TauCeti.Measure.map_prodMap_id_fst_glue` — the `(X, Y)`-marginal of `glue π κ` is `π`;
* `TauCeti.Measure.snd_glue` — its `(Y, Z)`-marginal is `π.snd ⊗ₘ κ`;
* `TauCeti.Measure.lintegral_glue` — the iterated-integral formula against `glue π κ`;
* `TauCeti.Measure.glue_deterministic` — gluing against a deterministic kernel is a pushforward,
  so a graph plan glues without adding randomness;
* `TauCeti.Measure.exists_glue_of_standardBorel_right` and
  `TauCeti.Measure.exists_glue_of_standardBorel_left` — **the gluing lemma**, in the two regimes
  obtained by disintegrating `σ` over `Y` (which needs `Z` standard Borel) and by disintegrating
  `π` over `Y` (which needs `X` standard Borel);
* `MeasureTheory.Measure.exists_glue_of_fst_eq` — the gluing lemma for two plans out of a common
  first space, realising both on `X × Y × Z`;
* `TauCeti.MeasureTheory.exists_glue_of_countable_middle` — **the gluing lemma over a countable
  middle space**, which needs nothing of either outer space;
* `TauCeti.Measure.exists_comp_of_exists_glue` — the composition of plans read off a glued measure,
  with `TauCeti.Measure.exists_comp_of_standardBorel_right`,
  `TauCeti.Measure.exists_comp_of_standardBorel_left` and
  `TauCeti.MeasureTheory.exists_comp_of_countable_middle` its three concrete forms;
* `TauCeti.Measure.lintegral_map_prodMap_id_snd_le` — the composition estimate: a cost on `X × Z`
  dominated by the sum of a cost on `X × Y` and a cost on `Y × Z` integrates against the composed
  plan to at most the sum of the two integrals. This is the mechanism behind the triangle
  inequality for transport costs.

## Implementation notes

Marginals of a measure on `X × Y × Z` are written as pushforwards along `Prod.map id Prod.fst`
(the `(X, Y)`-marginal), `Prod.map id Prod.snd` (the `(X, Z)`-marginal) and `Prod.snd` (the
`(Y, Z)`-marginal, which is `MeasureTheory.Measure.snd`).

The hypothesis relating the two plans is stated as `π.snd = σ.fst` rather than through a coupling
predicate: gluing needs neither of the two outer marginals, only the agreement of the middle one,
and stating it this way keeps the theorems usable by any packaging of couplings built on
`MeasureTheory.Measure.fst`/`MeasureTheory.Measure.snd`.

Two plans sharing a middle marginal, `π.snd = σ.fst`, admit a joint law on `X × Y × Z` with `π`
and `σ` as its two consecutive two-coordinate marginals, as soon as the middle space `Y` is
countable with measurable singletons. Neither outer space carries any hypothesis — in particular
neither is assumed standard Borel, so this is not a special case of either
`TauCeti.Measure.exists_glue_of_standardBorel_right` or
`TauCeti.Measure.exists_glue_of_standardBorel_left`, and conversely neither of those covers it.

When `Z` is nonempty the explicit witness is `TauCeti.Measure.glue π (countableCondKernel σ)`; use
it instead of this statement when the probability-measure or finiteness instances of the glued
measure are needed. -/

middle space is countable. Unlike the two standard Borel forms, this asks nothing of either outer
space. -/
