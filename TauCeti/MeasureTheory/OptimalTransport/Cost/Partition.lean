# Transport costs along finite partitions

Two measures of equal finite mass can be transported cell by cell along matching finite
measurable partitions of the two spaces. The deterministic estimate
`TauCeti.transportCost_le_sum_of_partition` bounds their transport cost by the cost inside
matching cells, weighted by the second measure, plus a bound on the cost times the mass by which
the first measure exceeds the second cell by cell. The plan matches the common mass inside each
cell (`TauCeti.transportCost_le_mul_of_ae_mem`) and moves the remaining mass arbitrarily; the
estimate combines with the subadditivity of the transport cost in its marginals.

## Main statements

* `TauCeti.transportCost_le_mul_of_ae_mem` — two measures of equal mass concentrated on sets on
  whose product the cost is at most `η` have transport cost at most `η` times their mass;
* `TauCeti.transportCost_le_sum_of_partition` — the transport cost of two measures of equal mass
  is controlled by matching finite partitions of the two spaces.

/-- **Transport along matching partitions.** Let `A` and `B` be finite measurable partitions of
`X` and `Y` indexed by the same type, such that the cost is at most `η i` on `A i × B i` and at
most `M` everywhere. Then two measures of equal finite mass have transport cost at most the sum of
the `η i` weighted by the masses `ν (B i)`, plus `M` times the total mass by which `μ` exceeds `ν`
cell by cell.

The plan matches the common mass `min (μ (A i)) (ν (B i))` inside each cell and moves the remaining
mass arbitrarily, at cost at most `M` per unit of mass. -/
