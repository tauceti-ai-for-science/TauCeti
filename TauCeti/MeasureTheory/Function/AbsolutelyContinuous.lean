# Absolutely continuous curves in pseudometric spaces

Mathlib defines `AbsolutelyContinuousOnInterval f a b` for maps `f : ℝ → X` into an arbitrary
pseudometric space, but states continuity (`AbsolutelyContinuousOnInterval.continuousOn`) and
bounded variation (`AbsolutelyContinuousOnInterval.boundedVariationOn`) only for maps into a
seminormed additive group. This file supplies both for an arbitrary pseudometric target, as needed
for curves in metric spaces which are not normed, such as spaces of probability measures with a
Wasserstein distance.

Both are transferred from the normed case along the Fréchet–Kuratowski embedding
`TauCeti.kuratowskiEmbedding` of a pseudometric space into the bounded continuous real functions
on it. This embedding is an isometry, so it preserves absolute continuity, continuity and
variation.

## Main results

* `AbsolutelyContinuousOnInterval.continuousOn'`: an absolutely continuous curve in a pseudometric
  space is continuous on its interval.
* `AbsolutelyContinuousOnInterval.boundedVariationOn'`: an absolutely continuous curve in a
  pseudometric space has bounded variation on its interval.
* `AbsolutelyContinuousOnInterval.prodMk`: a pair of absolutely continuous curves is an absolutely
  continuous curve in the product.
