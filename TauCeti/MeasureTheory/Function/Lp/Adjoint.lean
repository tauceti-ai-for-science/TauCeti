# `Lᵖ` bounds for an operator on `L²` from bounds for its adjoint

Let `T : L²(μ; E) → L²(ν; F)` be a bounded operator between `L²` spaces of Hilbert space valued
functions, and let `T†` be its Hilbert space adjoint. If `T†` is bounded from `L^{q'}` to
`L^{p'}` on `L²`, that is `‖T† g‖_{p'} ≤ C ‖g‖_{q'}` for every `g ∈ L²`, then `T` is bounded from
`Lᵖ` to `L^q` on `L²` with the same constant, where `p, p'` and `q, q'` are pairs of Hölder
conjugate exponents and `q < ∞`.

This is the duality argument that transfers a bound in one range of exponents to the dual
range: for instance the Calderón–Zygmund bound for `1 < p < 2` gives the bound for `2 < p < ∞`.
Neither `‖T f‖_q` nor `‖f‖_p` is assumed finite, so when `C < ∞` the theorem in particular shows
that `T` maps `L² ∩ Lᵖ` into `L^q`: the pairing of `T f` is only tested against bounded functions
of finite-measure support (`AEStronglyMeasurable.eLpNorm_le_of_forall_enorm_integral_inner_le`).

## Main declarations

* `ContinuousLinearMap.eLpNorm_le_of_eLpNorm_adjoint_le`: a `L^{q'} → L^{p'}` bound for the
  adjoint gives a `Lᵖ → L^q` bound for the operator.

/-- **Duality for operators on `L²`.** Let `T : L²(μ; E) → L²(ν; F)` be a bounded operator on a
σ-finite target, let `p, p'` and `q, q'` be Hölder conjugate with `q < ∞`, and suppose the
adjoint satisfies `‖T† g‖_{p'} ≤ C ‖g‖_{q'}` for every `g ∈ L²`. Then
`‖T f‖_q ≤ C ‖f‖_p` for every `f ∈ L²`. -/
