# The lower integral of a weight over a circle, and the length–area inequality

For a weight `g : ℂ → ℝ≥0∞` this file introduces `TauCeti.circleLIntegral g ζ ρ`, the lower
integral of `g` over the circle of centre `ζ` and radius `ρ` with respect to arc length, computed
through Mathlib's parametrisation `circleMap ζ ρ`, which for `ρ > 0` runs once around that circle
at the constant speed `ρ`:

`circleLIntegral g ζ ρ = ENNReal.ofReal ρ * ∫⁻ θ in Ioo (-π) π, g (circleMap ζ ρ θ)`.

For `ρ ≤ 0` the factor `ENNReal.ofReal ρ` makes the value `0`, a convention rather than a reading
of the parametrisation; the arc-length statements below are therefore statements about `ρ > 0`.

Two facts about it are proved, and they are the two halves of the classical **length–area method**.

The first is **polar Fubini**: integrating the circle integrals over all radii recovers the plane
integral,

`∫⁻ ρ in Ioi 0, circleLIntegral g ζ ρ = ∫⁻ z, g z`

(`TauCeti.lintegral_circleLIntegral_eq_lintegral`), for every measurable `g` and every centre `ζ`.
This is Mathlib's `Complex.lintegral_comp_polarCoord_symm` recentred at `ζ` and unfolded into an
iterated integral, the factor `ENNReal.ofReal ρ` in the definition being exactly the Jacobian
`ρ dρ dθ` of polar coordinates.

The second is **Cauchy–Schwarz on the circle**: the square of the circle integral of `g` is at most
`2 π ρ` — for `ρ > 0` the length of the circle — times the circle integral of `g ^ 2`
(`TauCeti.circleLIntegral_sq_le`). Dividing by `ρ` and integrating in `ρ`, polar Fubini reassembles
the right-hand side into the plane integral of `g ^ 2` and gives the **length–area inequality**

`∫⁻ ρ in Ioi 0, circleLIntegral g ζ ρ ^ 2 / ρ ≤ 2 π ∫⁻ z, g z ^ 2`

(`TauCeti.lintegral_circleLIntegral_sq_div_le_lintegral_sq`). Since the logarithmic measure
`∫⁻ ρ in Ioo r R, ρ⁻¹ = log (R / r)` of an annulus diverges as `r → 0`, a finite right-hand side
cannot keep `circleLIntegral g ζ ρ ^ 2` above a positive constant throughout a long annulus:
**Wolff's lemma** `TauCeti.exists_circleLIntegral_sq_lt` produces a radius `ρ` between `r` and `R`
with `circleLIntegral g ζ ρ ^ 2 < c` as soon as `2 π ∫⁻ z, g z ^ 2 < c * log (R / r)`.

The threshold `2 π ∫⁻ z, g z ^ 2 / log (R / r)` that lemma asks to be beaten falls to `0` as the
annulus is made longer, so for a weight of *finite* square integral it is beaten by every positive
`c` once the annulus is long enough. Shrinking the annulus onto the centre — take the outer radius
`R` as given and the inner one `R * exp (-L)` with `L` large — that is
`TauCeti.exists_circleLIntegral_lt_of_lintegral_sq_ne_top`: below every bound `R` there is a radius
`ρ` with `circleLIntegral g ζ ρ` smaller than any prescribed `c ≠ 0`. Equivalently, and sharply,
the circle integral has **lower limit zero at the centre**,
`TauCeti.liminf_circleLIntegral_nhdsGT_eq_zero`. Only a *lower* limit is available, and that is not
a defect of the proof: the weight `‖z - ζ‖⁻¹ / (2 π)` cut down to a sequence of thin annuli
`Ioo aₙ (aₙ * (1 + εₙ))` with `∑ εₙ` finite has finite square integral yet circle integral `1` at
every radius in those annuli, so `circleLIntegral g ζ ρ` need not tend to `0` as `ρ → 0`.

Nothing here is analytic: `g` is an arbitrary measurable weight, and the two inputs are the
polar-coordinate change of variables and Hölder's inequality. The analytic use is
`TauCeti/Analysis/Complex/Conformal/LengthArea.lean`, which takes `g` to be `‖deriv f‖ₑ` cut off
outside a set `s`, so that `circleLIntegral g ζ ρ` becomes the arc length of the image of a circular
arc under a holomorphic `f` and `∫⁻ z, g z ^ 2` its Dirichlet integral, hence the area of the image;
that file is the layer **L5** input of `TauCetiRoadmap/ConformalMapping/README.md`. Stating the
estimates for a weight keeps them available to any other length-versus-area argument — the plane
integral on the right need not be an area and the circle integral on the left need not be a length.

## Main definitions and results

* `TauCeti.circleLIntegral` — the lower integral of a weight over a circle with respect to arc
  length, through the parametrisation `circleMap`.
* `TauCeti.circleLIntegral_eq_lintegral_Ioc` — the angular integral may be taken over any period,
  so the branch cut at `±π` fixed in the definition is immaterial.
* `TauCeti.lintegral_circleLIntegral_eq_lintegral` — **polar Fubini**: the circle integrals about
  any centre integrate over the radii to the plane integral.
* `TauCeti.circleLIntegral_sq_le` — **Cauchy–Schwarz on the circle**: the square of the circle
  integral of `g` is at most the circumference times the circle integral of `g ^ 2`.
* `TauCeti.lintegral_circleLIntegral_sq_div_le_lintegral_sq` — the **length–area inequality**.
* `TauCeti.exists_circleLIntegral_sq_lt` — **Wolff's lemma**: a radius with small circle integral
  exists in every annulus whose logarithmic measure is large enough.
* `TauCeti.exists_circleLIntegral_lt_of_lintegral_sq_ne_top` — its limiting form for a weight of
  finite square integral: below every positive bound there is a radius at which the circle integral
  is smaller than any prescribed `c ≠ 0`.
* `TauCeti.liminf_circleLIntegral_nhdsGT_eq_zero` — the same statement as a lower limit: the circle
  integrals of a weight of finite square integral have lower limit `0` at the centre.

/-! ### The circle integral of a weight -/

/-- The **lower integral of the weight `g` over the circle** of centre `ζ` and radius `ρ`, taken
with respect to arc length: for `ρ > 0`, the angular integral of `g ∘ circleMap ζ ρ` scaled by the
speed `ρ` of that parametrisation.

Nothing is assumed of `g`, so this is a lower integral of a possibly non-measurable integrand. The
angle runs over `Ioo (-π) π`, one full period of `circleMap ζ ρ`; by
`TauCeti.circleLIntegral_eq_lintegral_Ioc` any other period gives the same value. A nonpositive
radius gives the value `0`, by the factor `ENNReal.ofReal ρ`: that is a deliberate convention, not
a property of the parametrisation, since for `ρ < 0` the map `circleMap ζ ρ` still runs once around
the circle of radius `|ρ|`, at speed `|ρ|` and in the same direction, only rotated by `π`. -/

/-! ### Small circle integrals at arbitrarily small radii -/

/-- **An annulus of prescribed logarithmic length inside a prescribed disc.** Shrinking the inner
radius of the annulus `Ioo r R` towards `0` sends `Real.log (R / r)` to `+∞`, so every target
length `L` is met by the inner radius `R * Real.exp (-L)`, which for `0 < L` is smaller than `R`.
This is how the outer radius is kept below a prescribed bound while Wolff's lemma is given as long
an annulus as it needs. -/

/-- **Wolff's lemma in the limit: a weight of finite square integral has small circle integrals at
arbitrarily small radii.** If `∫⁻ z, g z ^ 2` is finite then for every threshold `c ≠ 0` and every
bound `R > 0` there is a radius `ρ` below `R` with `circleLIntegral g ζ ρ < c`.

The threshold that `TauCeti.exists_circleLIntegral_sq_lt` asks to be beaten is
`2 π ∫⁻ z, g z ^ 2 / log (R / r)`, which for a finite square integral falls to `0` as the annulus
`Ioo r R` is made logarithmically longer; here the outer radius is the prescribed bound `R` and the
inner one `R * exp (-L)` is pushed towards `0`, which is what confines the radius produced to
`Ioo 0 R`. The reduction to a finite threshold is the passage to `min c 1`, and the square is undone
by monotonicity of squaring on `ℝ≥0∞`.

There is no companion statement for a *fixed* small radius: see
`TauCeti.liminf_circleLIntegral_nhdsGT_eq_zero` for the sharp form, a lower limit rather than a
limit. -/

/-- **The circle integrals of a weight of finite square integral have lower limit `0` at the
centre.** This is the sharp form of `TauCeti.exists_circleLIntegral_lt_of_lintegral_sq_ne_top`,
which says exactly that every positive threshold is undercut on every interval `Ioo 0 R` of radii,
and those intervals are a basis of `𝓝[>] 0`.

The limit itself does not exist in general: the circle integral is only *frequently* small, as the
thin-annulus weight described in the module docstring shows. -/
