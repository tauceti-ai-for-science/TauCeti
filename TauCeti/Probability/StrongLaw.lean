# The strong law of large numbers on a countable product space

Mathlib's `ProbabilityTheory.strong_law_ae` takes a sequence of pairwise independent, identically
distributed, integrable random variables on an abstract probability space. The canonical carrier of
such a sequence is the countable power `Measure.infinitePi fun _ : ℕ => Q` with its coordinate maps,
and this file specializes the strong law to it.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.Probability.strong_law_ae_infinitePi` — for `f` measurable and integrable against `Q`,
  the averages `n⁻¹ • ∑_{i < n} f (xᵢ)` converge `Q^{⊗ℕ}`-almost everywhere to `∫ f dQ`.

## Implementation

Independence of the coordinates is Mathlib's `ProbabilityTheory.iIndepFun_infinitePi` for the
identity variables. Nothing is reproved about product measures.

The strong law itself is then Mathlib's, applied to `x ↦ f (x i)`: the three hypotheses come from
that independence and from `measurePreserving_eval_infinitePi`, which makes the coordinates
identically distributed, transports integrability, and identifies the limit `𝔼[f ∘ eval 0]` with
`∫ f dQ`.

`f` is assumed measurable, not merely almost-everywhere strongly measurable as `Integrable f Q`
gives: it has to be composed with the coordinate maps, so that independence and identical
distribution of the coordinates transfer to the summands.

This is general probability theory with no exchangeability in its statements. It is used by the
conditional strong law for conditionally i.i.d. processes in
`TauCeti.Probability.Exchangeability.ConditionallyIID.StrongLaw`, where the conditional statement is
reduced fibrewise to this one over the mixing law; see
`TauCetiRoadmap/Exchangeability/README.md`, Layer 6 (the empirical-measure form of the
directing-measure theorem).

/-- **The strong law of large numbers on the canonical i.i.d. model.** For an `f` that is measurable
and integrable against `Q`, the averages of `f` along the coordinates of `Q^{⊗ℕ}` converge almost
everywhere to `∫ f dQ`.

This is Mathlib's `ProbabilityTheory.strong_law_ae` for the coordinate process of a countable
power; it is the form in which a statement about *some* i.i.d. sequence becomes a statement about
the product measure itself, and so can be integrated over a mixing law. -/
