# The finite-block factorization, via `L²`

For a contractable process on a standard Borel state space, the conditional law of any finite
strictly monotone block, given the process tail, factorizes into the directing measure's marginals:

```text
μ[blockIndicatorProd X k B | tailProcess X] =ᵐ[μ] ∏ i, (directingMeasure μ X ·).real (B i).
```

This is the single theorem the file provides. Integrating it over a tail event is what supplies
`hcore`, the hypothesis of `conditionallyIIDWith_of_measure_inter_blockCylinder_eq_setLIntegral`,
and hence `ConditionallyIIDWith μ X (directingProbabilityMeasure μ X)`; that integration step is
separate and does not live here.

## Why this route exists

`DeFinetti/BlockFactorization.lean` proves the same factorization through the reverse martingale
convergence theorem. This file reaches it from the `L²` averaging library instead, and imports
neither that module nor `TailFactorization`, `JointRectangle` or `Martingale.Convergence` — the
point of the `viaL2` route is that the factorization does not need a martingale.

Two inputs meet, and neither knows about the other:

*Selection invariance.* `Contractable.condExp_block_comp_tailProcess_ae_eq` says the conditional
law of a block given the tail is the same for every strictly monotone selection of that length.
The tuples appearing in a product of disjoint-window block averages are exactly such selections —
factor `i` reads its own window, and the windows are ordered, so `window_lt_window` makes each
tuple strictly monotone.

*Averaging.* `prod_blockAverage_window_eq_expect` writes a product of disjoint-window block
averages as a plain average over those tuples, so conditioning it on the tail returns the single
common value. Meanwhile the same product converges in `L¹` to `∏ i, (directingMeasure ω).real (B i)`
by the disjoint-window convergence theorem in `ViaL2/WindowProduct.lean`.
A constant sequence that converges must equal its limit, which is the factorization.

## Relation to the martingale route

`DeFinetti/BlockFactorization.lean` proves
`condExp_blockIndicatorProd_prefix_ae_eq_prod_directingMeasure`, the same factorization for the
*prefix* selection, through `TailFactorization` and reverse-martingale convergence. The overlap is
intentional: the two are the corresponding steps of the two roadmap routes. Their names record the
difference in what they *say* — `_prefix_` against `_strictMono_` — rather than how they are
proved; the roadmap's `_viaL2` route suffix is reserved for the public route endpoints.

This statement is strictly stronger than the prefix form: it holds for every strictly monotone
selection, not only `i ↦ i`, and does not assume `StandardBorelSpace Ω`. So the implication does
run one way — specializing `k` to `fun i : Fin r => (i : ℕ)` turns this into the prefix statement,
and any module importing this one can derive it (its `StandardBorelSpace Ω` hypothesis then being
unused). The converse is unavailable, the prefix form being weaker.

What separate proofs buy is therefore not logical independence but independent **import closures**.
A single Lean declaration carries a single proof and a single import closure, so making this
theorem the canonical source of the prefix statement would put the `L²` averaging library beneath
the martingale route. The genuinely shared ingredients — tail-conditioned selection invariance,
directing-measure integrability, the `ℝ≥0∞` conversion — are already factored into neutral modules
that both routes import.
