# Block-product factorisation and the de Finetti summit

The block-product factorisation of the conditional expectation, and — built directly on it — the
de Finetti summit for the reverse-martingale route.

Given that the selected coordinates of a contractable process are conditionally independent over the
tail σ-algebra, the conditional expectation of a block-indicator product factors as a product of the
directing measure on the coordinate sets:
```
μ[blockIndicatorProd X k C | tailProcess X] =ᵐ fun ω => ∏ i, (directingMeasure μ X ω).real (C i).
```
This chains Mathlib's `iCondIndepFun_iff_condExp_inter_preimage_eq_mul` (conditional independence ⟺
product of indicator conditional expectations) with
`Contractable.directingMeasure_ae_eq_condExp_coord` (each coordinate's conditional law is the
directing measure). The tail factorization
`condExp_blockIndicatorProd_tailProcess_ae_eq_prod` (from `TailFactorization`) then discharges the
finite-block rectangle identity for `directingProbabilityMeasure μ X`, exactly what
`mixedIIDWith_of_forall_rectangles` consumes — so the whole chain assembles here.

## Main results

* `condExp_blockIndicatorProd_prefix_ae_eq_prod_directingMeasure` — the prefix block factorization
  (the `L²` route proves a stronger, arbitrary-selection form independently, as
  `condExp_blockIndicatorProd_strictMono_tailProcess_ae_eq_prod_directingMeasure` in
  `DeFinetti/ViaL2/BlockFactorization.lean`; the overlap is the intended two-route structure and
  neither file imports the other)
  at the directing measure, the base case rectangle identities over a contractable process reduce
  to.
* `mixedIIDWith_of_contractable` — a contractable process on a standard Borel sample space
  is mixed i.i.d., with `directingProbabilityMeasure μ X` (the tail conditional law) as the
  witness. That witness is the canonical *directing measure*, not merely a mixing representative;
  what this file proves about that witness is the mixture identity. The sharp *existential*
  theorem on an arbitrary sample space is `conditionallyIID_of_contractable`; on path space,
  `conditionallyIIDWith_of_contractable_pathSpace` exposes its canonical tail-law witness
  explicitly.
* `mixedIID_of_contractable` — the existential form, for a contractable process on an
  arbitrary measurable sample space (state space still standard Borel).
* `mixedIID_of_exchangeable` — the exchangeable form (via `Exchangeable.contractable`).

The `..._of_iCondIndepFun_tailProcess` theorems expose the intermediate reduction (de Finetti given
tail conditional independence of the coordinates). All of the rectangle-mixture staging lemmas and
the standard-Borel-`Ω` existential are `private` (proof staging); the integrability and real/`ℝ≥0∞`
conversion facts this file runs on are `DirectingMeasure/Integral.lean`.

The reverse-martingale ("third") proof follows Kallenberg, *Probabilistic Symmetries and Invariance
Principles*, Theorem 1.1 (pp. 26–28). Adapted from `cameronfreer/exchangeability`
(`DeFinetti/ViaMartingale/CommonEnding.lean` and `DeFinetti/TheoremViaMartingale.lean`, pin
`e0532e59ceff23edab44dda9ab0655debbc9cc22`); here the factorisation is obtained by reuse of
Mathlib's `iCondIndepFun` characterisation rather than a hand-rolled π-system.
