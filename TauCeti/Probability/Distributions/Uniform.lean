# The uniform distribution on an interval

`uniformMeasure a b` is normalized Lebesgue measure on `Set.Ioc a b`, defined as
`ProbabilityTheory.cond volume (Set.Ioc a b)`.

**Why `cond` and not a fresh normalization.** Mathlib defines `MeasureTheory.pdf.IsUniform X s ℙ μ`
as `μ.map X = ProbabilityTheory.cond μ s`. Defining the measure by the same `cond` makes the bridge
`isUniform_of_hasLaw_uniformMeasure` hold definitionally, so no second normalization convention
enters the library and nothing has to be reconciled later.

**Boundary.** For `b ≤ a` the interval is empty and `uniformMeasure a b` is the zero measure
(`uniformMeasure_eq_zero_of_le`), not a probability measure. Every quantitative statement below
therefore takes `a < b` as a hypothesis rather than assuming it silently.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.Probability.uniformMeasure` — the uniform law on `Set.Ioc a b`;
* `TauCeti.Probability.uniformPDFReal` — the real-valued density. The `ℝ≥0∞`-valued density is
  Mathlib's `MeasureTheory.pdf.uniformPDF`, reused rather than redefined.

## Main results

* `isProbabilityMeasure_uniformMeasure` — it is a probability measure when `a < b`, and
  `isProbabilityMeasure_uniformMeasure_zero_one` is the instance for the standard interval;
* `uniformMeasure_Iio` and `uniformMeasure_Ici` — the measures of a lower and an upper tail;
* `uniformMeasure_eq_smul`, `uniformMeasure_apply` — its description as a rescaled restriction, and
  evaluation on a measurable set;
* `isUniform_of_hasLaw_uniformMeasure` — a variable with this law is uniform in Mathlib's sense;
* `uniformMeasure_eq_withDensity` and `rnDeriv_uniformMeasure` — Mathlib's `pdf.uniformPDF` is the
  density of this measure, as a `withDensity` and as the Radon–Nikodym derivative;
* `hasPDF_of_hasLaw_uniformMeasure` — a variable with this law satisfies `HasPDF`, i.e. its law is
  absolutely continuous; the density itself is identified by the two results above;
* `uniformPDF_eq_ofReal_uniformPDFReal` — the bridge between that density and the real-valued one;
* `cdf_uniformMeasure` — the cdf is `0` below `a`, `1` above `b`, and `(x - a) / (b - a)` between;
* `integral_id_uniformMeasure` — the mean is `(a + b) / 2`;
* `variance_id_uniformMeasure` — the variance is `(b - a) ^ 2 / 12`;
* `integrableExpSet_id_uniformMeasure` — every exponential moment exists, for every pair of
  endpoints;
* `mgf_id_uniformMeasure_zero` and `mgf_id_uniformMeasure` — the moment generating function, split
  at the removable singularity `t = 0`;
* `mgf_id_uniformMeasure_pos` — the mgf is strictly positive, which is what makes the cgf's
  logarithm meaningful;
* `cgf_id_uniformMeasure_zero` and `cgf_id_uniformMeasure` — the cumulant generating function, split
  the same way;
* `charFun_uniformMeasure_zero` and `charFun_uniformMeasure` — the characteristic function,
  likewise;
* `map_uniformMeasure_affine` — every uniform law is an affine image of the standard one;
* `measurable_uniformMeasure` — the family is measurable in its endpoints, so it can be used as a
  kernel. Other families keep their parameter-measurability results in family-specific
  `Measurability.lean` modules.

## Implementation

`uniformMeasure_eq_smul` rewrites `cond` into `(ENNReal.ofReal (b - a))⁻¹ • volume.restrict …` by
computing `volume (Set.Ioc a b)`; every integral below is then an interval integral times a scalar.
The variance goes through `ProbabilityTheory.variance_eq_integral`, which asks only for
`AEMeasurable`, rather than through the second-moment formula, which would need an `MemLp _ 2`
side condition.

Mathlib already supplies the `ℝ≥0∞`-valued density of a uniform law as
`MeasureTheory.pdf.uniformPDF s x μ = s.indicator ((μ s)⁻¹ • 1) x`, so none is introduced here —
the roadmap is explicit that no second pdf abstraction should enter the library. What is missing is
the real-valued form and the interval-specific identifications, which is what this section adds. -/

/-! ### Exponential transforms

The uniform law has bounded support, so *every* exponential moment exists and the moment generating
function is finite on all of `ℝ`. The formulas split at `t = 0`: the quotient
`(exp (t * b) - exp (t * a)) / ((b - a) * t)` has a removable singularity there, and rather than
push a proof through it the value `1` is given directly. -/

The cgf is the real logarithm of the mgf, so it is only meaningful once the mgf is known to be
strictly positive. That positivity is proved here rather than assumed: `mgf_id_uniformMeasure_pos`

/-! ### Affine transport

Every uniform law is an affine image of the standard one on `Set.Ioc 0 1`. This is what lets a
statement proved for `uniformMeasure 0 1` be transported to a general interval instead of reproved,
and it is the scalar case of the change-of-variables pattern the later families reuse.

The two supporting lemmas are `private`: both are generic facts about Lebesgue measure and affine
maps with no uniform-distribution content, and exposing them from a distribution-specific module
would put them in the wrong place. If a later target needs either publicly, relocating it to a
general measure module is its own focused change. -/

/-! ### Measurability in the endpoints -/

/-- Mathlib's uniform density on `Set.Ioc a b` is measurable jointly in the two endpoints and the
point.

This is the input `MeasureTheory.measurable_withDensity` needs; `measurable_uniformPDF_Ioc_volume`
fixes the endpoints and is too weak for it. -/

/-- **The uniform family is measurable in its endpoints.**

With `MeasureTheory.Measure` carrying the Giry measurable structure, this is what lets a uniform law
with random endpoints be assembled into a `ProbabilityTheory.Kernel`. No `a < b` hypothesis: on a
degenerate interval the value is the zero measure, which is where the map is constant. -/
