# Identifying Wishart laws through their characteristic function

The symmetric-matrix subspace is a complete second-countable real inner-product space, so
`MeasureTheory.Measure.ext_of_charFun` identifies two laws on it that share a characteristic
function. The characteristic function of either Wishart family is an exponential whose exponent
is linear in the degree, so the comparison below is arithmetic in that exponent.

The identity that comes out is that at a natural degree of at least the dimension, the
Gaussian-Gram law of a positive-definite scale is the nonsingular density law of the same degree
and scale. So the Gram sum of `ν ≥ p` independent centred Gaussian vectors with a nondegenerate
covariance has the classical Wishart density. This is the positive half of a dichotomy whose
negative half is `TauCeti.Probability.mutuallySingular_wishartGramMeasure_symmetricLebesgue`: too
few
Gaussian factors, or a degenerate covariance, leave the Gram law with no density at all.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.Probability.wishartGramMeasure_eq_nonsingularWishartMeasure` — the two families agree
  wherever
  both describe the same classical law.
* `TauCeti.Probability.hasLaw_wishartGram_gaussian_nonsingularWishartMeasure` — a Gaussian sample of
  size at
  least the dimension has a Gram sum with the nonsingular Wishart law.
* `TauCeti.Probability.ae_posDef_wishartGramMeasure` — such a Gram sum is almost surely nonsingular.
* `TauCeti.Probability.hasPDF_of_hasLaw_wishartGramMeasure` and
  `TauCeti.Probability.rnDeriv_wishartGramMeasure` — such
  a Gram law has a density against `TauCeti.symmetricLebesgue`, the nonsingular Wishart density.

/-- **The two Wishart families agree where both describe the same law.** With a positive-definite
scale and a natural degree at least the dimension, the Gaussian-Gram law of degree `ν` is the
nonsingular density law of the same degree and scale.

The bound `p ≤ ν` is exactly the range `(p : ℝ) - 1 < ν` of natural degrees on which a density
defines the nonsingular family. Below it that family is the zero measure, while the Gram law is
still a probability measure, carried by the singular matrices. -/
