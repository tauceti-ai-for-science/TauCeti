# Student's t distribution

Student's t law with `ν` degrees of freedom is the symmetric law on the line with density
proportional to `(1 + x ^ 2 / ν) ^ (-(ν + 1) / 2)`. This file defines it, proves that it is a
probability measure for `0 < ν`, identifies it as a `MeasureTheory.HasPDF` law with that density,
records its reflection symmetry, and identifies the one degree of freedom member of the family with
the standard Cauchy law. Polynomial and exponential moment results live in
`TauCeti/Probability/Distributions/StudentT/Moments.lean`.

**Boundary.** The number of degrees of freedom must be positive for the density to normalize, so
both `studentTPDFReal` and `studentTMeasure` are *defined* to vanish for `ν ≤ 0`
(`studentTMeasure_of_nonpos`); every formula describing the probability law carries `0 < ν` as a
hypothesis.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.Probability.studentTPDFReal` — the real-valued density;
* `TauCeti.Probability.studentTPDF` — its `ℝ≥0∞`-valued companion;
* `TauCeti.Probability.studentTMeasure` — the law;
* `TauCeti.Probability.studentTMeasure_def` — its `withDensity` presentation.

## Main results

* `isProbabilityMeasure_studentTMeasure` — it is a probability measure when `0 < ν`;
* `hasPDF_of_hasLaw_studentTMeasure`, `pdf_eq_studentTPDF_of_hasLaw_studentTMeasure` and
  `rnDeriv_studentTMeasure` — the `HasPDF` bridge, the density, and the Radon–Nikodym derivative;
* `studentTMeasure_map_neg` — the law is invariant under reflection in the origin;
* `studentTMeasure_one` — one degree of freedom gives the standard Cauchy law
  `ProbabilityTheory.cauchyMeasure 0 1`;
* `measurable_studentTMeasure` — the family is measurable in its parameter, so it can be used as a
  kernel.

## Implementation

The whole analytic content is the normalization. Scaling by `√ν` with
`MeasureTheory.integral_comp_mul_left` reduces the total mass of `(1 + x ^ 2 / ν) ^ (-(ν + 1) / 2)`
to that of the Cauchy-type kernel `(1 + x ^ 2) ^ (-(ν + 1) / 2)`, which is
`TauCeti.integral_one_add_sq_rpow`: the value `Β(1 / 2, ν / 2)` of Euler's second beta integral.
Writing that value as a quotient of Gamma values cancels the normalizing constant exactly. The
moment modules reuse the same normalization and symmetry facts.
