# The chi-squared distribution

The chi-squared law with `k` degrees of freedom is the gamma law of shape `k / 2` and rate `1 / 2`.
This file defines it for every real `k`, records its three parameter regimes, and transports the
elementary theory of the gamma law across the bridge: the density, the cumulative distribution
function, the mean `k`, the variance `2 * k`, the exponential-moment domain `Set.Iio (1 / 2)`, the
moment- and cumulant-generating functions there, and the characteristic function. It also proves
that the family is additive in its degrees of freedom.

**The three regimes.** Only `0 < k` gives a gamma law. At `k = 0` the shape would degenerate, and
the law is *defined* to be `Measure.dirac 0`: that is the value forced by additivity, since a
convolution unit must be a point mass at the origin, and it is the law of an empty sum of squared
standard Gaussians. Below `0` there is no law at all, and the measure is `0`. The boundary at
`k = 0` is singular with respect to Lebesgue measure, so it carries its own moment and transform
formulas rather than a density.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.Probability.chiSquaredPDFReal` — the real-valued candidate density formula,
  `x ^ (k / 2 - 1) * exp (-x / 2) / (2 ^ (k / 2) * Γ (k / 2))` on `[0, ∞)`,
  which is a probability density when `0 < k`;
* `TauCeti.Probability.chiSquaredPDF` — its `ℝ≥0∞`-valued companion, which is a probability
  density when `0 < k`;
* `TauCeti.Probability.chiSquaredMeasure` — the law.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.Probability.chiSquaredMeasure_eq_gammaMeasure` — the bridge to the gamma law;
* `TauCeti.Probability.isProbabilityMeasure_chiSquaredMeasure` — it is a probability measure for
  every `0 ≤ k`, the boundary `k = 0` included;
* `TauCeti.Probability.chiSquaredMeasure_eq_withDensity`,
  `TauCeti.Probability.hasPDF_of_hasLaw_chiSquaredMeasure` and
  `TauCeti.Probability.rnDeriv_chiSquaredMeasure` — the density, as a `withDensity`
  presentation, a `MeasureTheory.HasPDF` bridge and a Radon–Nikodym derivative;
* `TauCeti.Probability.measurable_chiSquaredMeasure` — measurability in the degrees of freedom,
  so the family can be used as a kernel;
* `TauCeti.Probability.cdf_chiSquaredMeasure_eq` — the cdf is `P (k / 2, x / 2)`;
* `TauCeti.Probability.integral_id_chiSquaredMeasure` and
  `TauCeti.Probability.variance_id_chiSquaredMeasure` — the mean `k` and the variance `2 * k`;
* `TauCeti.Probability.integrableExpSet_id_chiSquaredMeasure`,
  `TauCeti.Probability.mgf_id_chiSquaredMeasure` and
  `TauCeti.Probability.cgf_id_chiSquaredMeasure` — for `0 < k` the exponential moments exist
  exactly below `1 / 2`; on that half-line the mgf is `(1 - 2 * t) ^ (-(k / 2))` for every
  `0 ≤ k`;
* `TauCeti.Probability.charFun_chiSquaredMeasure` — the characteristic function is
  `(1 - 2 * I * t) ^ (-k / 2)`, for every real `t`;
* `TauCeti.Probability.integral_id_chiSquaredMeasure_zero`,
  `TauCeti.Probability.variance_id_chiSquaredMeasure_zero` and
  `TauCeti.Probability.charFun_chiSquaredMeasure_zero` — at the Dirac boundary `k = 0` the mean
  and variance vanish and the characteristic function is identically `1`;
* `TauCeti.Probability.chiSquaredMeasure_conv_chiSquaredMeasure` — degrees of freedom add under
  convolution;
* `TauCeti.Probability.chiSquaredMeasure_two` — two degrees of freedom give the exponential law of
  rate `1 / 2`.

## Implementation

Every positive-parameter statement is the gamma statement of shape `k / 2` and rate `1 / 2`, read
through `chiSquaredMeasure_eq_gammaMeasure`; nothing is recomputed. The arithmetic that remains is
the substitution `r = 1 / 2` in the gamma formulas: it turns `a / r` into `k`, `a / r ^ 2` into
`2 * k`, and `(1 - t / r) ^ (-a)` into `(1 - 2 * t) ^ (-(k / 2))`.

The density is stated in the textbook normalisation `2 ^ (k / 2) * Γ (k / 2)` rather than as
`gammaPDFReal (k / 2) (1 / 2)`, and `chiSquaredPDFReal_eq_gammaPDFReal` identifies the two; the
only content of that identification is `(1 / 2) ^ (k / 2) = (2 ^ (k / 2))⁻¹`.

The boundary `k = 0` uses the Dirac formulas of `TauCeti/Probability/Distributions/Dirac.lean`
together with Mathlib's `ProbabilityTheory.mgf_dirac'`, `ProbabilityTheory.variance_dirac` and
`MeasureTheory.charFun_dirac`. Its exponential-moment domain is all of `ℝ`, strictly larger than
the positive-parameter domain `Set.Iio (1 / 2)`, which is why the two regimes cannot share a
statement.
