# Invariance of conditional laws

If a measure-preserving map fixes every event of a conditioning σ-algebra up to null sets, then
almost every conditional law is invariant under that map. This is the invariance step in
decomposing a probability law into invariant components. The conditioning σ-algebra need not be
countably generated; standard Borelness is required only of the space carrying the conditional laws.

The proof uses Mathlib's kernel uniqueness (`Kernel.ae_eq_of_compProd_eq`): pushing forward
the second coordinate of the conditional joint law leaves its values on rectangles unchanged.
