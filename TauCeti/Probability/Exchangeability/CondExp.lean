# Conditional law of a contractable selection given the tail

For a contractable process `X`, the conditional law of a selection of coordinates given the future,
or given the tail, does not depend on *which* coordinates were selected. Four results, stated for
an arbitrary measurable real observable `f`:

* `Contractable.condExp_block_comp_future_ae_eq` — for two strictly monotone *blocks* of the same
  length lying below a cutoff `c`, the conditional expectations of `f` along each block, given the
  future σ-algebra `tailFamily X c`, agree a.e.
* `Contractable.condExp_comp_future_ae_eq` — its single-coordinate case, for heads `j, k` below the
  cutoff.
* `Contractable.condExp_block_comp_tailProcess_ae_eq` — the block form conditioning on the process
  tail `tailProcess X`.
* `Contractable.condExp_comp_tailProcess_ae_eq` — its single-coordinate case, the "extreme members
  agree on the tail" step.

The block forms are what a route needs in order to replace one selection by another *underneath* a
tail conditioning. The mechanism is distributional: both selections are appended to the same
future, and contractability equates the joint laws. Nothing here makes a tail event invariant under
reindexing.

All are facts about contractable processes alone, so they live in the shared exchangeability
layer: the `L²` route's Cesàro bridge consumes the general form, while the indicator
specializations the de Finetti directing-measure construction consumes are in
`TauCeti.Probability.DeFinetti.CondExpConvergence`.

/-- **A strictly monotone block joins a common future exactly as the path law does.** For a
contractable process, a strictly monotone selection `k` lying below a cutoff `c`, the joint law of
the block `(X (k 0), …, X (k (r-1)))` with the future `(X c, X (c+1), …)` is the path law pushed
through `prefixSplitEquiv r`, which is exactly that split.

Two such blocks therefore have the *same* joint law with the *same* future — which is what makes a
conditional statement given that future available. Note the equality is distributional: nothing
here says a tail event is pointwise invariant under reindexing. -/
