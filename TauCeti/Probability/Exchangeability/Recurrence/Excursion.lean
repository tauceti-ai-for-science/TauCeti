# Exchangeability of excursions

For a recurrent Markov exchangeable process started at `a₀`, the excursion process is
exchangeable. Prescribing its first excursions is a finite-path event; reordering the
excursions preserves the initial state and transition counts of that path, hence its mass.
The measurable excursion process and the event identity live in
`TauCeti.Probability.Process.Excursion.Basic`.

Recurrence makes the event comparison two-way. The deterministic absorbed walk in
`TauCeti.Probability.Exchangeability.Recurrence.AbsorbedWalk` shows that Markov
exchangeability alone does not ensure recurrence. De Finetti's theorem can then be applied
to the exchangeable excursion process, as in
`TauCeti.Probability.Exchangeability.Recurrence.Representation`.

For a recurrent Markov chain itself the excursions are not merely exchangeable but i.i.d.
(`TauCeti.Probability.Process.Excursion.MarkovChain`); in the language of de Finetti's theorem,
their directing measure is the constant excursion law.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.Probability.MarkovExchangeable.measure_setOf_excursionPrefix_eq_of_perm`: reordering a
  list of excursions does not change its probability.
* `TauCeti.Probability.MarkovExchangeable.exchangeable_excursionProcess`: the excursions of a
  recurrent Markov exchangeable process are exchangeable.
* `TauCeti.Probability.conditionallyIIDWith_excursionProcess`: the excursions of a recurrent
  Markov chain are conditionally i.i.d. with the constant excursion law as directing measure.

/-- **The excursion process of a recurrent Markov exchangeable process is exchangeable.**

This is the half of the Diaconis–Freedman representation theorem that consumes the recurrence
hypothesis. Its finite-dimensional laws are permutation invariant because each of them is the mass
of a finite path, and reordering the excursions of a path preserves both its initial state and its
transition counts — the sufficient statistic Markov exchangeability sees. -/
