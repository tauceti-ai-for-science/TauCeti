# The zero-one characterization of product laws

An exchangeable law on `ℕ → α` has trivial exchangeable σ-algebra exactly when it is an infinite
product law:

`exchangeableSigma_trivial_iff_iid`.

## The two directions

The product-to-zero-one direction is Hewitt–Savage, packaged for the product law itself as
`exchangeableSigma_trivial_of_infinitePi`.

The converse is the substantive half, and it runs at the level of the *mixing law* rather than the
directing map. The canonical witness `directingProbabilityMeasure` is `tailProcess`-measurable, and
`pathTail_le_exchangeableSigma` puts the path tail inside `exchangeableSigma`, so every preimage
`ν ⁻¹' A` is an exchangeable event. Triviality therefore makes `ρ.map ν` a zero-one measure on
`ProbabilityMeasure α`, hence a Dirac measure by
`IsZeroOneMeasure.exists_eq_dirac_probabilityMeasure`, and the de Finetti mixture representation
`pathLaw_eq_bind_infinitePi_of_mixedIIDWith` collapses to a single product.

Working at the mixing-law level avoids needing a general "measurable into `ProbabilityMeasure α`
implies almost everywhere constant" interface: the Giry-specific Dirac theorem is exactly the tool
for this situation. Note that `mixedIID_mixingLaw_unique` alone does *not* give the converse —
uniqueness of the mixing law is not the same as its being a point mass.
