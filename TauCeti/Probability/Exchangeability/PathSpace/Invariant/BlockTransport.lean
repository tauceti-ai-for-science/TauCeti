# Moving a block through a reindexing, over an invariant event

Over a shift-invariant event, a **law-preserving** reindexing that is eventually a translation
changes no set-integral; so for a **contractable** law, where strict monotonicity supplies that
preservation, a strictly increasing finite selection may be displaced onto the prefix
`0, 1, …, m - 1`.

Measure preservation cannot be dropped: without it the first claim fails outright — take `ρ` a
point mass at an alternating path, `A = univ` and `φ = (· + 1)`. Eventual translation is a
*sufficient* condition for the reindexing to fix every invariant event, not a necessary one for the
integral identity, which needs only `T ⁻¹' A = A`.

## Main results

* `measurePreserving_restrict_reindex_of_measurableSet_invariants_of_eventually_add` — the
  primitive: such a reindexing preserves the restricted law, so Koopman-side consumers get a
  `MeasurePreserving`, not only an integral identity;
* `ContractableLaw.map_restrict_prefixProj_of_strictMono_of_measurableSet_invariants` — the
  finite-selection form as a measure equality on the **restricted** law: reading a strictly
  increasing block and reading the prefix push `ρ.restrict A` to the same measure, so Bochner and
  `Lᵖ` statements follow as well. The unrestricted counterpart is the existing
  `ContractableLaw.map_prefixProj_of_strictMono`.

* `integral_mul_block_eq_prefixProj_of_strictMono_of_measurable_invariants` and its set-integral
  form `setIntegral_mul_block_eq_prefixProj_of_strictMono_of_measurable_invariants` (both in the
  `ContractableLaw` namespace) — the same displacement against an **invariant weight**, which is
  unchanged by the reindexing
  (`comp_reindex_apply_eq_of_measurable_invariants_of_eventually_add`) and so rides through the
  change of variables. An invariant event is a special invariant weight, so the second follows
  from the first by applying it to `A.indicator w`. This is the form an induction peeling one
  coordinate at a time needs, since the factors already peeled accumulate as such a weight.

* `ContractableLaw.measure_inter_blockCylinder_eq_prefix_of_strictMono_of_measurableSet_invariants`
  — the block-cylinder
  corollary: over an invariant event, the mass of a block cylinder does not depend on which
  strictly increasing selection cuts it, and may be read at the prefix.

The one `ℝ≥0∞` statement here is the block-cylinder mass corollary above, an equality of measure
values. The transport results themselves are not restated in `ℝ≥0∞`: a
consumer wanting that applies `.lintegral_comp` to the `MeasurePreserving` above, or rewrites with
`lintegral_map` through the measure equality. A weighted `ℝ≥0∞` form is available both ways: via
`.lintegral_comp` together with `comp_reindex_apply_eq_of_measurable_invariants_of_eventually_add`,
or as a measure equality on `ρ.withDensity w`, which the reindexing preserves because it preserves
`ρ` and fixes `w`. It is the *signed real* weight that cannot ride in an equality of positive
measures, which is why the `ℝ`-valued statements above are integral identities.

The endomorphism-level facts are Mathlib's: `MeasurePreserving.restrict_preimage` gives the
restricted measure preservation once the invariant event is rewritten by
`preimage_reindex_eq_of_measurableSet_invariants_of_eventually_add`, and
`MeasurePreserving.lintegral_comp` gives the integral identity. This module supplies only the
reindexing-and-invariant-event instance, and restates no Mathlib API.

Nothing here is specific to a de Finetti route. The statements mention a contractable path law, a
shift-invariant event and a finite selection, and no Koopman operator; the Koopman route is the
motivating consumer: `ViaKoopman/CylinderMass.lean` imports this for the block-cylinder corollary.

## Invariance, not tail-measurability

⚠ These results rest on *invariance*: `shift ⁻¹' A = A`, in the
`MeasurableSpace.invariants`-measurable form. A tail event need not satisfy it, and
`invariants_shift_lt_pathTail` shows the inclusion is strict already over `Bool`. This is the
substantive difference from the `L²` route, whose block comparison is distributional — an equality
of conditional laws given the tail — rather than an actual invariance of the test event.

The general statement asks only that the reindexing preserve the law. Contractability and strict
monotonicity are one way to obtain that, not requirements: a merely shift-invariant law with
`φ = (· + C)` qualifies.

## Source

No material is adapted from `cameronfreer/exchangeability`. That development carries its own
block-reindexing and factorization material for the Koopman argument; the statements here were
assembled from Tau Ceti's own pieces — the eventual-translation extension
`StrictMono.exists_strictMono_nat_extending_fin_eventually_add`, the invariant-event preimage
identity `preimage_reindex_eq_of_measurableSet_invariants_of_eventually_add`, contractable
reindexing `ContractableLaw.measurePreserving_reindex`, and Mathlib's
`MeasurePreserving.restrict_preimage`.

/-- **An invariants-measurable weight rides through the block-to-prefix change of variables.**

The unweighted statement is an equality of *positive* measures, so a signed real weight cannot ride
in it; that is why this is an integral identity. (A **nonnegative** weight can: the reindexing
preserves `ρ.withDensity w`, since it preserves `ρ` and fixes `w`. That is the route to an `ℝ≥0∞`
weighted statement, and is not restated here.)

The weight is unchanged by the reindexing, by
`comp_reindex_apply_eq_of_measurable_invariants_of_eventually_add`, so it passes through the
measure-preserving change of variables alongside the block observable. -/
