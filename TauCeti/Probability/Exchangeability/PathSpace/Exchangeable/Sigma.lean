# Exchangeable σ-algebra on path space

This file defines the σ-algebra of path-space events invariant under finitely supported
permutations of the time coordinate.  It also relates the one-sided path
tail σ-algebra to this exchangeable σ-algebra: a tail event is fixed by every finitely supported
time permutation.  Combined with `invariants_shift_le_pathTail`, this gives the chain

`invariants (shift α) ≤ pathTail α ≤ exchangeableSigma α`.
