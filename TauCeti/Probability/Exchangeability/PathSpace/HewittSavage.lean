# The Hewitt–Savage zero-one law

For an i.i.d. sequence, the exchangeable (symmetric) σ-algebra on path space is trivial:
every exchangeable event has probability `0` or `1` (`hewittSavage_trivial_of_iIndep`).

Kolmogorov's tail zero-one law does not subsume this. Tail triviality needs only independence,
whereas the symmetric σ-algebra can contain events that are not tail events: for a measurable `B`
with `B ≠ ∅` and `B ≠ Set.univ`, the event `{p | ∃ n, p n ∈ B}` is invariant under every
permutation of the coordinates, yet is not a tail event — some path witnesses it only at index
`0`, and changing that one coordinate moves the path out of the event, whereas tail events are
invariant under modification of finitely many coordinates. The qualification matters: for
`B = ∅` or `B = Set.univ`, or a one-point coordinate space, the event collapses to `∅` or
`Set.univ` and is a tail event after all.

`pathTail_le_exchangeableSigma` records the inclusion of the two σ-algebras formally; its strictness
is not formalized here.

Identical distribution enters only as the route to exchangeability of the path law: it is what
`Exchangeable.of_iIndepFun_identDistrib` consumes, and exchangeability is what the argument below
actually uses. It is sufficient for that, not necessary for the conclusion — the abstract form
`measure_eq_zero_or_one_of_exchangeableSigma` assumes an exchangeable law and the disjoint-block
product formula directly, and mentions identical distribution nowhere. A deterministic
independent sequence with distinct constant coordinates, for instance, is not identically
distributed yet has a Dirac path law, under which every event is trivial.

## Main results

* `hewittSavage_trivial_of_iIndep` — the zero-one law, from `iIndepFun` and `IdentDistrib`.
* `measure_eq_zero_or_one_of_exchangeableSigma` — the abstract form, over an exchangeable path law
  in which cylinders over disjoint index blocks are independent.
* `exchangeableSigma_trivial_of_infinitePi` — the zero-one law for the i.i.d. product law
  `P^{⊗ℕ}` itself.

Everything else in this file is `private` proof infrastructure: the block permutation, the
reindexed-cylinder change of variables, the cylinder approximation, and the disjoint-block product
formula. The final approximation squeeze — arbitrarily close factoring approximants force measure
`0` or `1` — is delegated to the shared zero-one criterion
`TauCeti.MeasureTheory.measure_eq_zero_or_one_of_forall_exists_symmDiff_lt_inter_eq_mul`.

## The argument

Approximate an exchangeable event by a cylinder over `[0, N)`, then move that cylinder onto the
disjoint block `[N, 2N)`. The mover is `Nat.blockSwap N`, the half-swap of `Fin (N + N)` transported
to `ℕ`: it is finitely supported, hence admissible for `exchangeableSigma`, so it fixes the event
while preserving the law. Independence then factors the event against its own moved copy, and
letting the approximation tighten gives `q = q²`.

The independence step lives on the source space rather than on path space —
`iIndepFun.indepFun_finset` applies to the coordinate tuples of `X`, and `Measure.map_apply`
transfers the resulting identity to `pathLaw μ X`. Stating it directly for a path-space measure
would first need a lemma transferring `iIndepFun` to the coordinate projections.

This discharges the Layer 2 target `hewittSavage_trivial_of_iIndep` of
`TauCetiRoadmap/Exchangeability/README.md`, and supplies the Layer 2 input the roadmap records for
the Layer 6 extreme-point corollary (the extreme exchangeable laws are exactly the i.i.d. laws).

Kolmogorov's tail zero-one law does not subsume this: tail triviality needs only independence,

path law, which is what the argument consumes; it is not claimed to be necessary for the
