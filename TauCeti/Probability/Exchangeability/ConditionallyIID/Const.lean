# Constant directing measures: the degenerate case of de Finetti

At a constant random measure `ω ↦ p`, the conditional and mixture identities coincide. Thus an
i.i.d. sequence is conditionally i.i.d. with its common law as a constant directing measure.

The equivalence itself holds at an arbitrary index type
(`conditionallyIIDWith_const_of_mixedIIDWith`, `conditionallyIIDWith_const_iff_mixedIIDWith`).
The *named-law* constant-witness API is likewise index-generic:
`MixedIIDWith.iIndepFun_of_const`, `mixedIIDWith_const_iff_iIndepFun_and_map_eq`, and
`MixedIIDWith.of_iIndepFun_map_eq` all take an arbitrary index type. Independence itself never
needed `ℕ` — Mathlib's `ProbabilityTheory.iIndepFun` is stated generically — the forward direction
enumerates finite subsets by *some* bijection with `Fin s.card` rather than by an order, and the
reverse direction takes the common law as a parameter instead of reconstructing it from a reference
coordinate.

The `of_iIndepFun_identDistrib` forms come in two shapes. The `_at` versions take a caller-supplied
reference coordinate `i₀` and hold at an arbitrary index type; the unsuffixed ones are their
`ℕ`-indexed specializations at `0`, kept because that is the ergonomic form for sequences and
because existing callers use it.

block law pushed forward by `Prod.mk p`, and the disintegration `δ_p ⊗ p^{⊗m}` is the product law
pushed forward by the same map, so the mixture identity already gives the joint one. -/
