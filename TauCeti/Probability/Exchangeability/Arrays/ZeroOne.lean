# Joint dissociation and the corner tail of an array

A dissociated array has no global randomness left to remember: the events readable from the entries
`X (i, j)` with both indices arbitrarily large are almost surely trivial.

The proof is Kolmogorov's. Fix a cutoff `n` past which the entries are measurable and read the
array from there on. The corners `[n, n + k] × [n, n + k]` and the tail block
`[n + k + 1, ∞) × [n + k + 1, ∞)` have disjoint index sets, so joint dissociation makes each corner
independent of the tail block, hence of `arrayTail X`, which the tail blocks contain. The corners
increase to the σ-algebra of all entries with both indices at least `n`, that is to
`arrayTailFamily X n`, which contains `arrayTail X`. So the array tail is independent of everything
readable above the cutoff, in particular of itself, and is therefore trivial.

The same argument run along the diagonal — corners `{(i, i) : n ≤ i ≤ n + k}` against the square
block over `[n + k + 1, ∞)` — makes the tail of the diagonal process `arrayDiag X` trivial as well,
and it asks only the diagonal entries beyond the cutoff to be measurable.

Two disjointness conditions per pair of blocks is what dissociation asks for, and `arrayTail` is
built to supply them: it is the **corner** tail, cutting *both* index axes at `n`. The row tail
`⨅ n, blockSigma X ([n, ∞) × ℕ)` is genuinely not trivial for a dissociated array — an array whose
rows are all one common i.i.d. random path is separately dissociated, and its row tail carries the
whole path.

**The converse holds for a jointly exchangeable array**: if the corner tail is trivial, the array
is jointly dissociated.

The ergodic form of the Aldous--Hoover representation is the dissociated one, and this is the
zero-one law separating it from the general form, together with its converse.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.Probability.JointlyDissociated.indep_arrayTailFamily_arrayTail` — the array tail of a
  jointly dissociated array is independent of everything readable above the cutoff, and in
  particular `TauCeti.Probability.JointlyDissociated.indep_arrayTail_self` of itself;
* `TauCeti.Probability.JointlyDissociated.measure_eq_zero_or_one_of_arrayTail` — **the zero-one
  law**: the tail σ-algebra of a jointly dissociated array is trivial;
* `TauCeti.Probability.JointlyDissociated.indep_tailProcess_arrayDiag_self` and
  `TauCeti.Probability.JointlyDissociated.measure_eq_zero_or_one_of_tailProcess_arrayDiag` — the
  same argument along the diagonal, giving a trivial tail for the diagonal process under
  measurability of the diagonal entries alone;
* `TauCeti.Probability.jointlyDissociated_of_forall_arrayTail_measure_eq_zero_or_one` — **the
  converse**: a jointly exchangeable array with trivial corner tail is jointly dissociated;
* `TauCeti.Probability.jointlyDissociated_iff_forall_arrayTail_measure_eq_zero_or_one` — the two
  together, **joint dissociation ↔ corner-tail triviality** for a coordinatewise measurable jointly
  exchangeable array under a zero-or-probability measure.

The converse adapts the representation-free strategy of `Graphon/RelRestrictionIndependence.lean`
(`VertexTailTrivial.isDissociated` and its private Lévy-downward factorization step) in
`cameronfreer/graphon` (Apache 2.0) at commit `175911f9d2e053f2a33d966658dfce0e4ae2811d`; the
array-level assembly — cylinders of the block σ-algebras, the window shift by joint
exchangeability, and the π-system passage to `Indep` — is developed here. No material is adapted
from `cameronfreer/exchangeability`, which treats exchangeable sequences rather than exchangeable
arrays.
