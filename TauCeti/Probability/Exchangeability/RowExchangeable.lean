# Row exchangeable arrays and the factorization of their directing measure

An array `Y : ι × ℕ → Ω → α` is **row exchangeable** when its law is unchanged by permuting the
entries of each row separately: for every family `π : ι → Equiv.Perm ℕ` of time permutations, one
for each row, the array `(a, k) ↦ Y (a, π a k)` has the law of `Y`. This is the symmetry of the
array of successors of a Markov exchangeable process, and it is stronger than asking that each row
be exchangeable on its own, because the permutations may be chosen independently.

Reading an array column by column gives the process `arrayColumn Y : ℕ → Ω → (ι → α)`, whose
`k`-th value is the vector of the `k`-th entries of all rows. Row exchangeability contains the
diagonal case `π = fun _ => σ`, so `arrayColumn Y` is a fully exchangeable process valued in
`ι → α`, which for countable `ι` and standard Borel `α` is again standard Borel. De Finetti's
theorem therefore hands the columns a directing measure `λ : Ω → ProbabilityMeasure (ι → α)`.

The theorem of this file is that the extra, off-diagonal part of the symmetry makes that directing
measure **factor over the rows**: almost surely, its mass on a finite box
`{x | ∀ a ∈ F, x a ∈ B a}` is the product over `a ∈ F` of its one-row masses. So conditionally on
the directing measure distinct rows are independent, while the entries are identically distributed
within each row. This is the mixture-of-independent-i.i.d.-rows form that the Diaconis–Freedman
representation of Markov exchangeable processes consumes.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.Probability.RowExchangeable`: invariance of the array law under independent
  permutations of the individual rows;
* `TauCeti.Probability.arrayColumn`: the array read as a process of columns.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.Probability.RowExchangeable.fullyExchangeable_row` and
  `TauCeti.Probability.RowExchangeable.fullyExchangeable_arrayColumn`: each row, and the column
  process, is fully exchangeable;
* `TauCeti.Probability.rowExchangeable_iff_forall_prodCongrRight_mem_finitary`: it suffices to
  check families of row permutations that move only finitely many cells altogether;
* `TauCeti.Probability.RowExchangeable.map_values`: closure under coordinatewise pushforward;
* `TauCeti.Probability.RowExchangeable.measure_setOf_forall_pair_eq`: the combinatorial core —
  the probability that each row of a finite set lands in its own target set at two prescribed
  times does not depend on which two times are prescribed;
* `TauCeti.Probability.RowExchangeable.ae_apply_pi_union`: the directing measure of the column
  process is almost surely multiplicative across disjoint sets of rows;
* `TauCeti.Probability.RowExchangeable.ae_apply_pi_eq_prod` and
  `TauCeti.Probability.RowExchangeable.exists_directing_pi_eq_prod`: the resulting product formula
  over a finite set of rows, at a given witness and at the witness de Finetti supplies;
* `TauCeti.Probability.RowExchangeable.measure_setOf_forall_mem_eq_lintegral_prod`: the mass of an
  event reading finitely many pairwise distinct cells is the mixture of the product of the row
  marginals' masses — the form in which a consumer reads a finite block of array entries.

## Implementation

The multiplicativity is proved by a second-moment argument that never leaves the world of finite
blocks. Write `C` and `D` for the boxes cut out by two disjoint finite sets of rows. The mixture
identity turns each of

```text
∫ λ(C ∩ D)²,      ∫ λ(C ∩ D) · λ(C) · λ(D),      ∫ λ(C)² · λ(D)²
```

into the probability of an array event in which **every** row involved is tested at exactly two
times — times that differ from term to term. Row exchangeability moves those times back to `0` and
`1` one row at a time, so the three integrals coincide, and the integral of
`(λ(C ∩ D) - λ(C) · λ(D))²` vanishes.

Only the mixture identity `MixedIIDWith` is used, not the joint-law disintegration: the argument
tests the directing measure against nothing but block probabilities, so the factorization theorem
needs no standard Borel structure at all. That hypothesis enters exactly once, in the de Finetti
wrapper at the end, which is what produces a witness in the first place. Countability of the row
index is present throughout, since it is what makes an array with a.e. measurable entries an a.e.
measurable map into `ι × ℕ → α`.

/-- **Distinct cells of a row exchangeable array are conditionally independent given the mixing
representative of its columns.** The joint mass of finitely many *pairwise distinct* cells landing
in prescribed measurable sets is the mixture, over the mixing representative, of the product of the
masses that its individual row marginals give those sets.

This is the form the array law is consumed in downstream: an event that reads finitely many entries
of the array, no two of them the same cell, has the mass of an independent product, once the mixing
representative is integrated out. Distinctness is essential — a repeated cell is read twice and is
of course not independent of itself.

The cells are grouped by their column index, where the mixture identity of the columns applies,
and the row factorization `TauCeti.Probability.RowExchangeable.ae_apply_pi_eq_prod` splits each
column's contribution into one factor per row it constrains. Injectivity enters twice: it makes the
cells in a single column pairwise distinct as rows, and it makes the two nested products a single
product over cells. -/
