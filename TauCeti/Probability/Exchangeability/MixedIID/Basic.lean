# Mixed i.i.d. families

A family is *mixed i.i.d.* when there is a measurable random probability measure
`ν : Ω → ProbabilityMeasure α` such that every finite block of **distinct** coordinates has, as
its law, the `ν`-mixture of the corresponding product measure, and every coordinate is
`μ`-a.e. measurable. `MixedIIDWith μ X ν` names the witness `ν`; `MixedIID` is the existential
wrapper.

⚠ This is a property of the **unconditional** finite-dimensional laws: the mixture identity
constrains each finite block's marginal law, never the joint law of `(ν, X)`. It is therefore
*not* conditional independence, and is deliberately not named `ConditionallyIID` — that name
belongs to the genuine joint-law disintegration
`Law(ν, block) = ∫ δ_{ν ω} ⊗ (ν ω)^{⊗m} dμ(ω)` (Kallenberg 2005, §1.1 eq. (2)), which strictly
strengthens the identity below at a fixed `ν`: for a nondegenerate mixing law an *independent
copy* of a directing measure also witnesses `MixedIIDWith`, while the family is not
conditionally i.i.d. given it. Following the roadmap's terminology, a `ν` witnessing only the
mixture identity is a **mixing representative**; *directing measure* is reserved for the
conditional predicate's witness.

The index type is arbitrary, matching `ConditionallyIIDWith`: the definition quantifies only over
injective selections `Fin m → ι`, and nothing in it uses the order structure of `ℕ`. Sequence-level
users get the `ι = ℕ` case by unification.

Exchangeability splits along that line. At an arbitrary index type the mixture identity gives
`MixedIIDWith.exchangeableFamily`, in `TauCeti.Probability.Exchangeability.Family`; the
sequence-level `MixedIIDWith.exchangeable` and `.exchangeableAt`, which conclude the `ℕ`-indexed
`Exchangeable` predicate, stay in `MixedIID/Implications.lean`.

The other *consequences* over `ℕ` — `prefixLaw_eq_mixture`,
`blockLaw_eq_prefixLaw_of_injective`, contractability, the path-law
representation, and mixing-law uniqueness — remain sequence-level, because those genuinely use
prefixes, shifts, or `ℕ`-indexed products.

This file adds the Layer 0 mixed-i.i.d. definitions and destructors, together with the Layer 1
rectangle-factorization characterization used by the common de Finetti ending. The exchangeability
implications live in two places, along the same line as above: the sequence-level
`MixedIIDWith.exchangeable` and `.exchangeableAt`, which conclude the `ℕ`-indexed `Exchangeable`,
are in `MixedIID/Implications.lean`; the index-generic `MixedIIDWith.exchangeableFamily` and
`MixedIID.exchangeableFamily`, which conclude `ExchangeableFamily`, are in
`Exchangeability/Family.lean` beside the conditional analogue they mirror.

These declarations follow the roadmap signatures in
`TauCetiRoadmap/Exchangeability/README.md` and
`TauCetiRoadmap/Exchangeability/Suggested.lean`, Layer 0, refining the existential
`MixedIID` of the roadmap into a named-witness relation (`MixedIIDWith`) plus its existential
wrapper. They are adapted from the `cameronfreer/exchangeability` Layer 0 sources pinned at
`e0532e59ceff23edab44dda9ab0655debbc9cc22`, with Tau Ceti API names and hypotheses.

/-- Mixed i.i.d.-ness with a specified mixing representative `ν`: the coordinates are a.e.
measurable, the random measure `ν` is measurable, and along every finite selection `k` of
**distinct** coordinates the block law is the `ν`-mixture of the product measure
`ProbabilityMeasure.pi (fun _ => ν ω)`. Distinctness (`Function.Injective k`) is what product
laws need, in contrast with the order condition `StrictMono` of `Contractable`.

Coordinatewise a.e. measurability is part of the definition because `Measure.map` sends a
function that is not a.e. measurable to a junk Dirac mass, so the mixture identity alone
cannot see measurability; compare `ProbabilityTheory.HasLaw` in Mathlib. -/
