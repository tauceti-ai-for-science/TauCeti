# Expanding a product of averages over disjoint windows

Writing `window N i j = (i + 1) * N + j` for the `i`-th block of `N` consecutive indices, a product
of block averages over these windows expands as an average of products over tuples:

```text
∏ i, blockAverage (Y i) (window N i) = 𝔼 js, ∏ i, Y i (window N i (js i))
```

Two facts make this the right shape for the block factorization.

*The expansion is exact.* It is `Fintype.prod_sum` together with the normalisation
`(N ^ m)⁻¹ = ∏ i, (N : ℝ)⁻¹`, so no error term appears.

*Every tuple is an injective selection.* The windows are pairwise disjoint —
`window N i j < window N i' j'` whenever `i < i'` **and** `j < N` — so distinct coordinates of a
tuple, whose entries are indices in `Fin N`, always carry distinct indices
(`window_selection_injective`). This is what removes the diagonal terms that an expansion
over a *single* window would produce, and it is why the factorization can apply a
contractability argument to every term of the average without exception.

## The moving selection

The same windows also appear as a *moving* selection, in the shape the `L²` convergence theorems
quantify over: `disjointWindow c` is the family `n ↦ (j ↦ window (n + 1) c j)`, so at each length
factor `c` reads `[(c + 1)(n + 1), (c + 2)(n + 1))`. Two facts make it usable there —
`disjointWindow_injective` at each length, with `disjointWindow_eventually_injective` the eventual
form those theorems take, and `disjointWindow_ne` for disjointness across factors.

That combination is what fixed starts cannot supply: windows from two distinct fixed starts overlap
once the common length exceeds the gap between the starts, whereas these move outward as the length
grows. The generic fixed-start selection is `fixedStart` in `Process/BlockAverage.lean`.

## References

Nothing here involves a measure or the `L²` theory: the module is index arithmetic plus
block-average algebra, which is why it sits with the process API rather than under
`Exchangeability/L2/`.
