# Empirical measures of sequences

This file defines the empirical probability measure of a nonempty finite population
(`empiricalMeasureOfFintype`) and, as its `κ := Fin (n + 1)` case, of the first `n + 1` terms of a
sequence (`empiricalMeasure`), together with their evaluation, integration, and measurability API.
The successor indexing is what supplies the `Nonempty` instance for the sequence form, so it needs
no side condition, and it matches the shape used in limit theorems.

There is one construction, not two: the sequence form is *defined* as the specialization, so the
two can never drift apart.

It also provides `empiricalMeasureOfFintype` for a population indexed by an arbitrary nonempty
finite type. This is the finite-population form used by quantitative sampling arguments.

The construction is a uniform finite sum of Dirac measures.  It is the process-level prerequisite
for the empirical-measure form of de Finetti's theorem in the `Exchangeability` roadmap.
