# The excursions of a recurrent Markov chain are i.i.d.

Fix a transition kernel `κ` on a countable discrete state space and a state `a₀` that the chain
started at `a₀` returns to infinitely often almost surely. Cutting a path at its returns to `a₀`
turns it into the sequence of its excursions, and this file proves that **that sequence is
i.i.d.**: the excursions are independent (`TauCeti.Probability.iIndepFun_excursionProcess`), and
each of them is distributed as the first one
(`TauCeti.Probability.map_excursionProcess_eq_excursionLaw`). Concatenating the excursions back
therefore recovers the chain from an infinite product measure,

```text
markovChainLaw (Measure.dirac a₀) κ
  = (Measure.infinitePi fun _ : ℕ => excursionLaw κ a₀).map (pathOfExcursions a₀)
```

(`TauCeti.Probability.markovChainLaw_eq_map_pathOfExcursions`), which is the regenerative
structure of a Markov chain at a recurrent state. Nothing here involves any distributional
symmetry; the excursion process and the reconstruction of a path from its excursions are those of
`TauCeti.Probability.Process.Excursion.Basic` and
`TauCeti.Probability.Process.Excursion.Reconstruction`.

## The mechanism

The mass a Markov chain gives a finite path is a product of transition weights, and the
consecutive pairs of a loop word are the consecutive pairs of its excursion loops, gathered
excursion by excursion (`TauCeti.consecutivePairs_loopPath`). So the mass of a loop factors as the
product of the masses of its individual excursion loops
(`TauCeti.Probability.markovChainLaw_apply_setOf_loopPathAt`), a product of
`TauCeti.Probability.excursionWeight`s. Once the chain has made the return closing the last of
them, prescribing the first excursions of a path is exactly prescribing the loop word it spells out
(`TauCeti.Probability.measure_setOf_excursionPrefix_eq`), so the finite-dimensional laws of the
excursion process are products and the excursions are independent with a common law.

Recurrence is a genuine hypothesis, not a technicality: a chain that leaves `a₀` and is absorbed
elsewhere never returns, and its excursion process is junk.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.Probability.excursionWeight`: the product of transition weights along a given finite
  word followed by a return to `a₀`; for a Markov kernel, this is the corresponding path mass.
* `TauCeti.Probability.excursionLaw`: the law of the first excursion of the chain started at `a₀`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.Probability.markovChainLaw_apply_setOf_loopPathAt`: the mass of a loop is the
  product of the weights of its excursions.
* `TauCeti.Probability.excursionLaw_apply_singleton`: once the chain returns to the base state,
  the law of an excursion is given by the excursion weights.
* `TauCeti.Probability.prefixLaw_excursionProcess_eq_pi`: the finite-dimensional laws of the
  excursion process are products.
* `TauCeti.Probability.iIndepFun_excursionProcess` and
  `TauCeti.Probability.map_excursionProcess_eq_excursionLaw`: **the excursions of a recurrent
  Markov chain are i.i.d.**, with common law `excursionLaw`.
* `TauCeti.Probability.markovChainLaw_eq_map_pathOfExcursions`: **the chain is the concatenation of
  i.i.d. excursions.**
* `TauCeti.Probability.ae_infinite_setOf_eq_markovChainLaw_const` and
  `TauCeti.Probability.excursionLaw_const`: the returning hypothesis is satisfiable, and on the
  chain that never leaves `a₀` the excursion law is the point mass at the empty word.
