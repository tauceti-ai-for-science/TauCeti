# Strong connectivity of the directed graph of a matrix

A square matrix `A` with entries in a partially ordered type determines a directed graph on its
index set, with an edge from `i` to a distinct `j` when `0 < A i j`. When the off-diagonal
entries are nonnegative, strong connectivity of this directed graph is the same as the absence of
a disconnecting cut: no nonempty proper set of indices has all of its outgoing entries zero.

For a symmetric `A` the directed graph is an ordinary graph and strong connectivity is ordinary
connectedness; the cut condition is then the form in which
[Stacks, Tag 0C6Z](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/0C6Z) states the connectedness condition
on the intersection matrix of a numerical type.

## Main results

* `Matrix.forall_reflTransGen_ne_and_pos_iff`: for a matrix with nonnegative off-diagonal
  entries, strong connectivity of its directed graph is the absence of a disconnecting cut.
* `Matrix.eq_smul_of_mulVec_eq_zero`: if a matrix over a linear ordered field has nonnegative
  off-diagonal entries and strongly connected positive-entry graph, then every vector in its
  kernel is proportional to any strictly positive vector in its kernel.

/-- For a matrix `A` whose off-diagonal entries are nonnegative, strong connectivity of the
directed graph with an edge from `i` to a distinct `j` when `0 < A i j` is equivalent to the
absence of a disconnecting cut: no nonempty proper set of indices `s` has all of its outgoing
entries `A i j`, for `i ∈ s` and `j ∉ s`, zero. No symmetry of `A` is assumed, so the left-hand
side is connectedness of an ordinary graph only when `A` is symmetric, as the intersection matrix
of a numerical type is. The right-hand side is then the form in which
[Stacks, Tag 0C6Z](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/0C6Z) states the connectedness condition
on a numerical type, so this is what supplies the `connected` field of `TauCeti.NumericalType`
when one is constructed.

The nonnegativity hypothesis is what turns a nonzero cross-entry into a positive one, and so
cannot be dropped. -/

/-- The weighted maximum principle for a matrix over a linear ordered field: if its off-diagonal
entries are nonnegative, its positive-entry graph is strongly connected, and its kernel contains
a strictly positive vector `m`, then every kernel vector is a scalar multiple of `m`. This is
useful for proving that kernels of connected intersection matrices have rank one. -/
