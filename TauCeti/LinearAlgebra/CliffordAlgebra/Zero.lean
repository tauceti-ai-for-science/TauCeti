# Clifford algebras of zero-dimensional modules

The Clifford algebra of a subsingleton module consists only of scalars. This file records the
canonical algebra equivalence with the coefficient ring and the resulting elementary behavior of
the grading and reversal. These statements let low-dimensional Clifford-group calculations handle
dimension zero without choosing a concrete model for the zero module.

The equivalence generalizes Mathlib's `CliffordAlgebraRing.equiv` from its concrete zero quadratic
form on `Unit` to any subsingleton module.

## Main results

* `CliffordAlgebra.equivOfSubsingleton` identifies a zero-dimensional Clifford algebra with its
  coefficient ring.
* `CliffordAlgebra.even_eq_top_of_subsingleton` says that every element is even.
* `CliffordAlgebra.reverse_eq_self_of_subsingleton` says that reversal is the identity.
