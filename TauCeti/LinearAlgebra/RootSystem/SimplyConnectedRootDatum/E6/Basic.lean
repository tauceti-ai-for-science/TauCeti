# The simply connected root datum of type `E₆`

This file constructs the pinned integral root datum of type `E₆` on the character and cocharacter
lattices `Fin 6 → ℤ`. The character lattice is written in the fundamental-weight basis and the
cocharacter lattice in the simple-coroot basis, so that the `i`-th simple root is the `i`-th row of
the Bourbaki-numbered Cartan matrix `CartanMatrix.E 6` and the `i`-th simple coroot is the `i`-th
standard basis vector.

## The coordinates

A coroot is stored by its coordinates in the simple coroots, and the corresponding root by its
pairings against the simple coroots. Because `E₆` is simply laced, a root and its coroot have the
same simple-root coordinates, so a single stored vector determines both: if a coroot has
coordinates `c`, then the root has coordinates `⟨β, αⱼ^∨⟩ = ∑ i, cᵢ ⟨αᵢ, αⱼ^∨⟩`, that is, the
Cartan-matrix image of `c`. That relation is `TauCeti.DynkinType.e6Root_eq_mulVec`, and it is what
makes every later step structural rather than a second table: the root reflections are the image of
the coroot reflections under a linear map, and the pairing is symmetric because `CartanMatrix.E 6`
is.

The seventy-two roots — the count fixed by `TauCeti.DynkinType.numRoots` — are ordered with the six
simple roots first, in Bourbaki order, then the remaining thirty positive roots by height and then
lexicographically in their simple-root coordinates, and finally the thirty-six negative roots in
the matching order. The last positive root is therefore the highest root, whose simple-root
coordinates are the Bourbaki marks `(1, 2, 2, 3, 2, 1)`.

Only the coroots are asked to span their lattice, and only that half is recorded, in
`TauCeti.DynkinType.corootSpan_e6SimplyConnectedRootDatum_eq_top`. The roots span the root lattice,
which sits inside the weight lattice with index `3` — the determinant of `CartanMatrix.E 6` — so the
datum carries no `RootPairing.IsRootSystem` instance. That asymmetry is what "simply connected"
means here.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.DynkinType.e6Coroot` and `TauCeti.DynkinType.e6Root`: the coroot coordinate embedding and
  the root embedding derived from it by the Cartan-matrix map.
* `TauCeti.DynkinType.e6SimplyConnectedRootDatum`: the pinned root datum of type `E₆`.
* `TauCeti.DynkinType.e6SimpleIndex`: the first six root indices, the Bourbaki-numbered simple
  roots.
* `TauCeti.DynkinType.e6SimplyConnectedBase`: the base they form.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.DynkinType.e6Root_eq_mulVec`: the root coordinates are the Cartan-matrix image of the
  coroot coordinates.
* `TauCeti.DynkinType.root_e6SimpleIndex` and `TauCeti.DynkinType.coroot_e6SimpleIndex`: the `i`-th
  simple root is the `i`-th row of `CartanMatrix.E 6` and the `i`-th simple coroot is
  `Pi.single i 1`, which is what pins the two lattices as the weight and coroot lattices.
* `TauCeti.DynkinType.hasCartanType_e6SimplyConnectedRootDatum`: the pinned base has Cartan type
  `E6`.
* `TauCeti.DynkinType.corootSpan_e6SimplyConnectedRootDatum_eq_top`: the coroots span the
  cocharacter lattice, the simply connected condition.

/-! ## The Cartan matrix as the bridge between the two embeddings -/

/-- **The root coordinates are the Cartan-matrix image of the coroot coordinates.**
Writing a coroot as `β^∨ = ∑ i, cᵢ αᵢ^∨` in the simple coroots, the pairings of `β` against the
simple coroots are `⟨β, αⱼ^∨⟩ = ∑ i, cᵢ ⟨αᵢ, αⱼ^∨⟩`, which is the `j`-th entry of the
Cartan-matrix image of `c` because `CartanMatrix.E 6` is symmetric.

This is deliberately not a `simp` lemma: unfolding a root into the Cartan-matrix image of its
coroot is a change of representation, not a normal form, and it would take the left-hand sides of
the lemmas below out of normal form. -/
