# The short-root weight table of type F4

This file tabulates twenty-six elements of the type-`F₄` character lattice: the twenty-four short
roots, each once, and the zero weight twice. The numbering of the nodes is the Bourbaki one, in
which the nodes `0` and `1` are long and the nodes `2` and `3` are short, and the entries are
expressed in the fundamental-weight basis `Fin 4 → ℤ`, so the `i`th coordinate of an entry is its
pairing with the `i`th simple coroot.

This is the weight table on which the explicit twenty-six-dimensional representation of
`TauCeti.Algebra.Lie.F4.ShortRoot.Basic` is constructed. Nothing here identifies it with the
weight multiset of the irreducible representation of highest weight `ϖ₄`. The first entry is
`ϖ₄`, which is the highest short root; the ordering is by decreasing height, with the two
zero-weight entries adjacent, as in the minuscule tables of types `E₆` and `E₇`.

The short roots generate the root lattice of `F₄`, which is also its weight lattice, and the
spanning statement `TauCeti.DynkinType.span_range_f4ShortRootWeight_eq_top` records that the
twenty-six weights span the full character lattice `Fin 4 → ℤ`. It is the input that lets the
weight torus of an integral carrier built on this weight diagram be a closed immersion.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.DynkinType.f4ShortRootWeight`: the twenty-six weights in fundamental coordinates.
* `TauCeti.DynkinType.f4ShortRootWeight_eq_zero_iff`: the two zero-weight indices.
* `TauCeti.DynkinType.range_f4ShortRootWeight_eq`: the values of the table are exactly the zero
  weight and the short roots of `F₄`.
* `TauCeti.DynkinType.span_range_f4ShortRootWeight_eq_top`: the weights span the character
  lattice.

## References

The node numbering and the root coordinates follow Bourbaki, *Lie Groups and Lie Algebras,
Chapters 4--6*, Plate VIII. The table is not quoted from a source: it was derived from the root
data of the pinned `F₄` datum by listing the twenty-four roots of squared length one in the
fundamental-weight coordinates of `TauCeti.DynkinType.f4Root`, by decreasing height, and
inserting the zero weight twice at height zero. `TauCeti.DynkinType.range_f4ShortRootWeight_eq`
proves that the values are exactly the short roots and the zero weight.

/-! ## The weight table -/

/-- **The short-root weight table of type `F₄`**: the twenty-four short roots, each once, and the
zero weight twice.

Coordinates are pairings with the four Bourbaki-numbered simple coroots. The ordering begins at
`ϖ₄ = (0, 0, 0, 1)`, lists the twenty-four short roots by decreasing height, and places the two
copies of the zero weight at the indices `12` and `13`; no mathematical structure depends on the
ordering. -/
