# The classical model of type `Cₙ` in the pinned coordinates

This file sets up the coordinates in which
`TauCeti.DynkinType.typeCSimplyConnectedRootDatum` is built, and proves everything about the roots
of type `Cₙ` that can be said before they are indexed: the two coordinate families, the signed
classical basis vectors `± e_a` out of which every root is a sum of two, and the action of a
reflection on those signed basis vectors.

Write `e₀, …, e_{n-1}` for the standard basis of the classical model `ℤ ^ n`, in which the roots of
type `Cₙ` are the short roots `± e_a ± e_b` with `a ≠ b` and the long roots `± 2 e_a`, with simple
roots `αᵢ = eᵢ - eᵢ₊₁` for `i < n - 1` and `α_{n-1} = 2 e_{n-1}`. The corresponding simple coroots
are `αᵢ^∨ = eᵢ - eᵢ₊₁` and `α_{n-1}^∨ = e_{n-1}`, and they are a basis of the classical lattice,
which is what makes `Cₙ` the classical family whose whole construction stays inside the classical
basis vectors: both

```text
weight n a   = (⟨e_a, αₖ^∨⟩)ₖ         = ([a = k] - [a = k + 1])ₖ,
coweight n a = (coefficient of αₖ^∨)ₖ = ([a ≤ k])ₖ
```

are integral, the second because `e_a = ∑ a ≤ k, αₖ^∨`. Everything here is a finite calculation with
these two families, resting on the single identity
`TauCeti.DynkinType.TypeC.weight_dotProduct_coweight`, which says that the pinned pairing sees the
classical pairing `⟨e_a, e_c⟩ = [a = c]` exactly.

The reflection in the root `p + q` acts on signed basis vectors by the involution exchanging `p`
with `-q` and `-p` with `q`; that is `TauCeti.DynkinType.TypeC.signedReflection`, and its
uniformity in the shape of the root is what makes the two reflection axioms one five-case
calculation rather than one case per pair of shapes. The long roots are the case `p = q`, where the
coroot is the halved `p` rather than `p + q`, and that is the only asymmetry between the two
calculations.

## The domain of the pair operations

A pair `(p, q)` of signed basis vectors names a root only when `q ≠ signedNeg p`. On the excluded
diagonal `q = -p` the sum `p + q` is zero, which is no root, and there is no reflection in it, so
outside that hypothesis `TauCeti.DynkinType.TypeC.pairRoot`,
`TauCeti.DynkinType.TypeC.pairCoroot` and `TauCeti.DynkinType.TypeC.signedReflection` are total
functions carrying auxiliary data with no root-theoretic meaning. Every substantive lemma below
accordingly assumes `q ≠ signedNeg p`, and the root indices of the datum are built so that the
hypothesis always holds.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.DynkinType.TypeC.weight` and `TauCeti.DynkinType.TypeC.coweight`: the character- and
  cocharacter-lattice coordinates of a classical basis vector.
* `TauCeti.DynkinType.TypeC.pairRoot` and `TauCeti.DynkinType.TypeC.pairCoroot`: the root `p + q`
  and its coroot, in those coordinates, for `q ≠ signedNeg p`.
* `TauCeti.DynkinType.TypeC.signedReflection`: the reflection in `p + q`, on signed basis vectors,
  for `q ≠ signedNeg p`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.DynkinType.TypeC.span_range_weight_eq_top`: the classical weights span the full
  character lattice in every rank.
* `TauCeti.DynkinType.TypeC.signedWeight_signedReflection` and
  `TauCeti.DynkinType.TypeC.signedCoweight_signedReflection`: the reflection acts as the reflection
  formula says it does.
* `TauCeti.DynkinType.TypeC.pairRoot_reflection` and
  `TauCeti.DynkinType.TypeC.pairCoroot_reflection`: the transported form of those two identities,
  which is what the root datum's reflection axioms consume.
