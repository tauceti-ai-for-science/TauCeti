# The listed `E₈` coroots are all the norm-two vectors

The two hundred and forty coroots of type `E₈` are enumerated in
`TauCeti.LinearAlgebra.RootSystem.SimplyConnectedRootDatum.E8.Basic` as coordinate vectors in the
simple-coroot basis. This file proves that the enumeration is *complete*: a vector of
`Fin 8 → ℤ` whose `E₈` norm is two is one of the two hundred and forty listed coroots
(`TauCeti.DynkinType.exists_e8Coroot_eq`).

Completeness is what turns reflection into a permutation of the root indices, since the reflection
of a norm-two vector in another one is again of norm two, by an identity of bilinear algebra. It
therefore replaces the two hundred and forty by two hundred and forty table of reflected indices
that a direct construction would have to tabulate and check.

## The argument

The `E₈` norm `(v ᵥ* CartanMatrix.E 8) ⬝ᵥ v` is the Gram form of the simple-coroot basis, so the
norm-two vectors are the minimal vectors of the `E₈` lattice, read in that basis. They are counted
in the Euclidean model instead, where the lattice is described by congruences rather than by a Gram
matrix. To keep the coordinates integral the model is scaled by two: `IsDoubledE8` describes
`2 · Γ₈`, whose vectors of norm eight are of exactly two shapes, `(±2)` in two coordinates and
`(±1)` in all eight with an even number of minus signs. Those shapes are the 112 even minimal
vectors (the norm-two roots of type `D₈` scaled by two, supplied by
`TauCeti.DynkinType.typeDRootEquiv`) and the 128 odd minimal vectors with an even number of minus
signs.

The map `e8DoubledEmbed` sends the simple-coroot coordinates to the doubled Euclidean model by
multiplying with `TauCeti.DynkinType.e8DoubledSimpleRoot`, the shared integral table of
`TauCeti.LinearAlgebra.RootSystem.E8Coordinates`; it multiplies the norm by four, so it carries
norm-two vectors to norm-eight vectors of `2 · Γ₈`. It is injective, and the listed coroots are two
hundred and forty distinct norm-two vectors, so their images already exhaust the two hundred and
forty vectors of the enumeration, and no norm-two vector is left over. The classification is used
only through this counting step: neither the surjectivity of `e8DoubledEmbed` onto `2 · Γ₈` nor the
equality of the two lattices is needed, and neither is proved. The counting scaffold built on the
table is therefore private to this file; the completeness statement is its only public consequence.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.DynkinType.exists_e8Coroot_eq`: a norm-two vector of the simple-coroot lattice is one of
  the listed `E₈` coroots.

/-! ## The doubled `E₈` lattice and its vectors of norm eight -/

/-- The doubled `E₈` lattice `2 · Γ₈` in Euclidean coordinates: a vector all of whose coordinates
are congruent modulo two and whose coordinate sum is divisible by four.

Doubling clears the half-integral coordinates of `Γ₈`, so this is a sublattice of `ℤ⁸`: an integral
vector of `Γ₈` doubles to an all-even vector with coordinate sum in `4ℤ`, and a half-integral one
doubles to an all-odd vector with the same property. Only the inclusion
`isDoubledE8_e8DoubledEmbed` is needed below, so this file never proves that the condition cuts out
exactly the doubled lattice. -/
