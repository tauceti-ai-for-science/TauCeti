# The fork bound for finite-type Cartan matrices

A connected finite-type diagram is a tree whose vertices have degree at most three. Such a tree may
branch at several vertices, and a branch vertex together with a choice of path into each of its
three branches carries a **star**: that vertex as the centre, with three arms hanging off it. Which
stars survive is the fork half of the "chain/fork length constraints" of the Cartan-Killing
classification, and it is an arithmetic constraint. Writing `p, q, r` for the numbers of vertices on
the three arms *counting the centre*, a star of finite type satisfies

`1 / p + 1 / q + 1 / r > 1`,

whose solutions with `p ≤ q ≤ r` are `(1, q, r)`, `(2, 2, r)`, `(2, 3, 3)`, `(2, 3, 4)` and
`(2, 3, 5)` - the chains `Aₙ`, the forks `Dₙ`, and `E₆`, `E₇`, `E₈`.

Only that arithmetic constraint is proved here. The step that produces a star from a diagram with a
branch vertex is outside this file, and so is the constraint governing a multiple edge (the one
behind `B`, `C`, `F₄`), which is
`TauCeti.LinearAlgebra.RootSystem.FiniteType.DoubleEdge.Basic`.

This file builds the star as a matrix, `TauCeti.starCartanMatrix`, out of the chain entries of
`TauCeti.LinearAlgebra.RootSystem.Chain`, over an arbitrary finite index type of arms, and proves
the bound. The elimination tool is a new one, living with the others in
`TauCeti.LinearAlgebra.RootSystem.FiniteType.Basic`: a finite-type matrix admits no nonzero
**subdominant** vector, one whose every coordinate `xᵢ` has `xᵢ · (A x)ᵢ ≤ 0`
(`TauCeti.IsFiniteType.eq_zero_of_forall_mul_sum_apply_mul_nonpos`), because the symmetrized
quadratic form evaluates at such a vector to `∑ᵢ dᵢ xᵢ (A x)ᵢ ≤ 0`. The certificate for a star is
its vector of **marks** `TauCeti.starMark`, which decreases linearly along each arm, from `p q r` at
the centre down to `q r` at the far end of the first arm. The marks are annihilated by the matrix
at every arm vertex, and at the centre they take the value `qr + pr + pq - pqr`, which is `≤ 0`
exactly when the fork bound fails.

The three critical stars, where the marks are a genuine null vector, are the extended Dynkin
diagrams `Ẽ₆ = T(3, 3, 3)`, `Ẽ₇ = T(2, 4, 4)` and `Ẽ₈ = T(2, 3, 6)`; they are recorded as
corollaries. Since the argument is uniform in the number of arms, the `n`-armed form of the bound,
`∑ᵢ 1 / pᵢ > n - 2`, comes out at the same time, and at `n = 4` with every `pᵢ = 2` it reproves the
exclusion of `D̃₄` that `TauCeti.not_isFiniteType_affineD₄` gets from the degree bound.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.StarIndex`: the vertices of a star - a centre `none`, and `ℓ i` further vertices on the
  arm `i`, the vertex `some ⟨i, t⟩` sitting at distance `t + 1` from the centre.
* `TauCeti.starCartanMatrix`: the Cartan matrix of a star, simply laced by construction.
* `TauCeti.starIndexCongrArms`: the relabelling of the vertices of a star induced by a relabelling
  of its arms, under which both the Cartan matrix (`TauCeti.starCartanMatrix_comp`) and finite type
  (`TauCeti.isFiniteType_starCartanMatrix_comp_iff`) are invariant.
* `TauCeti.starMark`: the marks of a star, the test vector the bound is proved with.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.card_sub_two_lt_sum_inv_of_isFiniteType_star` and
  `TauCeti.not_isFiniteType_starCartanMatrix_of_sum_inv_le`: **the fork bound**,
  `∑ᵢ 1 / (ℓ i + 1) > n - 2` for a star of finite type with `n` arms, and its contrapositive.
* `TauCeti.one_lt_sum_inv_of_isFiniteType_star_three` and
  `TauCeti.not_isFiniteType_starCartanMatrix_three_of_sum_inv_le_one`: the same pair for three arms,
  where the bound reads `1 / p + 1 / q + 1 / r > 1`.
* `TauCeti.eq_zero_or_eq_one_one_or_eq_one_two_le_four_of_isFiniteType_star_three`:
  **the admissible three-armed shapes**. A finite-type
  star with arms of `a ≤ b ≤ c` further vertices has `a = 0` (a chain), or `a = b = 1` (a fork of
  type `D`), or `a = 1`, `b = 2` and `c ≤ 4` (types `E₆`, `E₇`, `E₈`). The solutions are read off
  Mathlib's `ADEInequality.lt_three`, `.lt_four` and `.lt_six`.
* `TauCeti.not_isFiniteType_affineE₆`, `TauCeti.not_isFiniteType_affineE₇`,
  `TauCeti.not_isFiniteType_affineE₈`: the three critical stars are not of finite type.

/-! ### The three-armed case

The classification meets the bound at a branch vertex, where there are exactly three arms and the
inequality reads `1 / p + 1 / q + 1 / r > 1`. Its solutions are the chains, the forks of type `D`,
and the three exceptional shapes.

This is the exclusion half of the classification of forks. The converse, that each of these shapes
