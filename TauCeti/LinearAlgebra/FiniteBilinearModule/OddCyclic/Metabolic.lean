# Vanishing Gauss sign does not imply metabolicity

Nikulin's odd cyclic generator of order five with coefficient two has Gauss sign zero
but has no quadratic Lagrangian. Nondegeneracy would force the squared order of such a
Lagrangian to be five, which is impossible.

More generally, a nondegenerate odd cyclic module whose order is not a square is not metabolic.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.FiniteQuadraticModule.not_isMetabolic_oddCyclic`: the nonsquare-order obstruction.
* `isNondegenerate_and_gaussSign_eq_zero_and_not_isMetabolic_oddCyclic_five`:
  the concrete order-five counterexample with coefficient two.

## References

* V. V. Nikulin, *Integral symmetric bilinear forms and some of their applications*,
  Proposition 1.11.2 for the odd-generator Gauss-sign formula.
