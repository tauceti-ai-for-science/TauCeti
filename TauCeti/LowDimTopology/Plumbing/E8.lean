# The negative-definite E₈ plumbing

This file defines the `E₈` plumbing used as the first concrete calculation in the lattice-homology
lane. Its eight vertices all have framing `-2`; vertices `0, ..., 6` form a chain and vertex `7`
is attached to vertex `2`. Thus the negative of its intersection matrix is the `E₈` Cartan
matrix.

The proof of negative-definiteness gives an explicit integral completion of squares. This both
certifies the plumbing without appealing to a classification theorem and records a formula useful
for checking later computations on this example.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.e8Plumbing`: the `-2`-framed plumbing on the `E₈` Dynkin tree.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.e8Plumbing_adj`: the seven edges of the plumbing.
* `TauCeti.e8Plumbing_neg_intersectionForm`: the completed-square identity for the negative
  intersection form.
* `TauCeti.e8Plumbing_isNegativeDefinite`: the `E₈` plumbing is negative definite.
* `TauCeti.e8Plumbing_not_isZero_latticeHomology`: its characteristic-two lattice homology is
  nonzero in every spin^c structure.

This advances `TauCetiRoadmap/CombinatorialHeegaardFloer/README.md`, Lane L, and specifically its
acceptance check asking that lattice homology be computed for the negative-definite `E₈` plumbing
of the Poincaré sphere. The plumbing convention follows Némethi,
