# Negative-definiteness of the plumbing intersection form

This file records what the negative-definiteness hypothesis buys at the level of the integral
intersection form, rather than only at the level of its matrix. Lattice homology is built on a
*negative-definite* plumbing, and the property used throughout the theory is that the form is
strictly negative on every nonzero lattice vector, which in particular implies that it is
nondegenerate, so the plumbing lattice carries no isotropic directions and the lattice points it
indexes are separated by the form.

The matrix-level definition `PlumbingGraph.IsNegativeDefinite` says that the negated intersection
matrix is positive definite, i.e. `0 < xᵀ (-A) x` for every nonzero integer vector `x`. Here we
transport that statement through `Matrix.toBilin'` to the bilinear form
`PlumbingGraph.intersectionForm`, obtaining the self-pairing sign, the resulting vanishing
criterion, nondegeneracy, and the injectivity of multiplication by the intersection matrix. As a
self-validating example the `A₂` plumbing (two `-2`-framed spheres joined by an edge) is shown to
be negative definite.

Three further results are the quantitative half of the same hypothesis: nonvanishing of `det A`,
Cauchy--Schwarz, and finiteness of the superlevel sets of the self-pairing. Cauchy--Schwarz for
the form — which needs only that the self-pairing is nonpositive, so it is stated for that
hypothesis alone — bounds every pairing by the two self-pairings, and applying it to the basis
spheres bounds each coordinate of `A x` in terms of `P.intersectionForm x x`. Since `A` acts
injectively, only finitely many lattice points can have their self-pairing above a fixed bound:
the self-pairing is a proper function to `-∞`. This finiteness is what makes the sublevel sets of
Némethi's weight function finite, hence what makes lattice homology a limit of finite
computations.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.PlumbingGraph.IsNegativeDefinite.intersectionForm_self_neg`: the intersection form is
  strictly negative on every nonzero lattice vector.
* `TauCeti.PlumbingGraph.isNegativeDefinite_iff_forall_intersectionForm_self_neg`: this strict
  self-pairing inequality characterizes negative-definiteness.
* `TauCeti.PlumbingGraph.IsNegativeDefinite.intersectionForm_self_nonpos`: the self-pairing is
  always nonpositive.
* `TauCeti.PlumbingGraph.IsNegativeDefinite.intersectionForm_self_eq_zero_iff`: the self-pairing
  vanishes exactly at the origin.
* `TauCeti.PlumbingGraph.IsNegativeDefinite.intersectionForm_nondegenerate`: the form is
  nondegenerate.
* `TauCeti.PlumbingGraph.IsNegativeDefinite.mulVec_injective`: multiplication by the intersection
  matrix is injective, so the lattice embeds along the form.
* `TauCeti.PlumbingGraph.IsNegativeDefinite.det_intersectionMatrix_ne_zero`: the intersection
  matrix has nonzero determinant.
* `TauCeti.PlumbingGraph.sq_intersectionForm_le`: Cauchy--Schwarz for the intersection form.
* `TauCeti.PlumbingGraph.IsNegativeDefinite.finite_setOfPred_le_intersectionForm_self`: only
  finitely many lattice points have self-pairing above a fixed bound.
* `TauCeti.a2Plumbing_isNegativeDefinite`: the `A₂` plumbing is negative definite.

Only semidefiniteness is needed, so the hypothesis is the nonpositivity of the self-pairing
rather than negative-definiteness; on a negative-definite plumbing it is supplied by
`IsNegativeDefinite.intersectionForm_self_nonpos`. Both self-pairings being nonpositive, the
right-hand side is a product of two nonpositive integers. -/

Cauchy--Schwarz against the basis sphere `e v` bounds the square of the `v`-th coordinate of
`A x` by `P.intersectionForm x x * P.weight v`, hence by a constant depending only on `c`; so
`A x` ranges over a finite box, and `x ↦ A x` is injective. Equivalently, the self-pairing is a
proper function `(V → ℤ) → ℤ` tending to `-∞`. -/
