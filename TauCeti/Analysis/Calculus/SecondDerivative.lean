# The second derivative as a derivative

The second derivative `fderiv 𝕜 (fderiv 𝕜 g) x` of a map between normed spaces is, by definition,
the derivative at `x` of the map `fderiv 𝕜 g`. Mathlib supplies the differentiability of
`fderiv 𝕜 g` at a twice continuously differentiable point through `ContDiffAt.fderiv_right`; this
file packages that into the single `HasFDerivAt` statement that second-order arguments use, so
that the identification is made once rather than at each use.

An invertible second derivative therefore lets the differential avoid any prescribed value `c`
on some punctured neighbourhood of the point, the neighbourhood being allowed to depend on `c`.
That fixed-value avoidance is the local rigidity behind the isolation of nondegenerate critical
points, and it asks nothing of the value taken.

The file also records that on an open set the second directional derivative
`x ↦ D(Dg(·) v)(x) v` of a `C²` map is continuous, and the second-order chain rule
`D²(f ∘ φ)(v, w) = D²f(Dφ v, Dφ w) + Df(D²φ(v, w))`. At a point where the differential of the outer
function vanishes the first-order term drops out, so the second derivative of a composition is the
second derivative of the outer function evaluated on the images of the differential of the inner
one, i.e. the second derivative transforms as a bilinear form. The second derivative of a
separated sum `φ ∘ Prod.fst + ψ ∘ Prod.snd` on a product is the block-diagonal map built from the
second derivatives of the summands. Finally, the second derivative of a directional derivative
`y ↦ Dg(y) v` is the third derivative of `g` evaluated at `v`, and differentiating the symmetry
of the second derivative shows that the third derivative is symmetric in its last two
directions. No statement
here mentions critical points as such, so all of them belong here rather than with the Morse theory
that uses them.

## Main results

* `ContDiffAt.hasFDerivAt_fderiv`: at a twice continuously differentiable point,
  `fderiv 𝕜 g` is differentiable, with derivative the second derivative of `g`.
* `ContDiffOn.continuousOn_fderiv_fderiv_apply`: on an open set, the second directional
  derivative of a `C²` map in a fixed direction is continuous.
* `TauCeti.eventually_fderiv_ne`: where the second derivative is invertible, the differential
  avoids any prescribed value on a punctured neighbourhood of the point.
* `TauCeti.fderiv_fderiv_comp_apply`: the second-order chain rule for `C²` maps.
* `TauCeti.fderiv_fderiv_comp_apply_of_fderiv_eq_zero`: for `C²` maps, where the differential of
  the outer function vanishes, the second derivative of a composition is the pullback of the
  second derivative along the differential of the inner function.
* `TauCeti.fderiv_fderiv_comp_fst_add_comp_snd`: the second derivative of a separated sum on a
  product is block diagonal.
* `TauCeti.fderiv_fderiv_fderiv_apply`: the second derivative of a directional derivative of a
  `C³` map is its third derivative.
* `TauCeti.fderiv_fderiv_fderiv_apply_comm`: the third derivative of a sufficiently smooth map is
  symmetric in its last two directions.

the point.** Nothing is assumed about the value `c`, and in particular the differential need not
vanish at `x`. The punctured neighbourhood on which `c` is avoided may depend on `c`, so this is
avoidance of one fixed value rather than local injectivity of `fderiv 𝕜 g`. -/
