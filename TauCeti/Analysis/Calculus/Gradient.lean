# The gradient is an isometric conjugate-linear image of the Fréchet derivative

Mathlib defines `gradient f x`, written `∇ f x`, as the Riesz representative
`(InnerProductSpace.toDual 𝕜 F).symm (fderiv 𝕜 f x)` of the Fréchet derivative of a scalar
function on an inner product space, and develops its differential calculus. This file records the
three consequences of the defining formula that come from `toDual` being a *conjugate-linear
isometric equivalence*: the gradient has the same norm as the derivative, it is additive, and it
is conjugate-homogeneous. Since `toDual` is moreover continuous, the gradient of an arbitrary
function is Borel measurable, as the Fréchet derivative is.

These are exactly what is needed to see a family of gradients as a conjugate-linear,
norm-preserving image of the corresponding family of derivatives. Over `ℝ` it is linear; for
instance, `φ ↦ ∇ φ` is linear on real-valued test functions, and `‖∇ φ‖` may be estimated by any
theorem about `‖Dφ‖`.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.norm_gradient_eq_norm_fderiv`: `‖∇ f x‖ = ‖fderiv 𝕜 f x‖`.
* `TauCeti.gradient_add`: additivity of the gradient at a point of differentiability.
* `TauCeti.gradient_const_smul`: `∇ (c • f) x = conj c • ∇ f x`.
* `TauCeti.gradient_of_notMem_tsupport`: the gradient vanishes off the topological support.
* `TauCeti.measurable_gradient`: the gradient of any function is measurable.
* `ContDiff.gradient_right`: over `ℝ`, where `toDual` is linear, the gradient of a `C^{m+1}`
  function is `Cᵐ`.
* `TauCeti.isSymmetric_of_hasFDerivAt_gradient`: over `ℝ`, the derivative of the gradient (the
  Hessian as an endomorphism of `E`) is a symmetric operator wherever it exists, provided the
  function is differentiable nearby.
