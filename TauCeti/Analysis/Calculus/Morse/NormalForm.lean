# The Morse lemma

Near a nondegenerate critical point a smooth function is, in suitable coordinates, exactly its
Hessian quadratic form.  This file proves that, for a real-valued smooth function on a Banach
space, in the form
`TauCeti.IsNondegenerateCriticalPoint.exists_morse_chart`: there is a chart `ψ` at the critical
point `x`, carrying `x` to `0`, with both coordinate maps smooth on their domains, and with

`f y = f x + 2⁻¹ * fderiv ℝ (fderiv ℝ f) x (ψ y) (ψ y)`

on the whole of its source.  Nondegeneracy is the one from
`TauCeti.Analysis.Calculus.Morse.Basic`: the second derivative, read as a map from the space to
its dual, is a linear homeomorphism.  In finite dimensions that is the classical condition that
the Hessian be a nondegenerate bilinear form, so this is the classical Morse lemma; in infinite
dimensions it is the strong nondegeneracy of Morse theory on Banach and Hilbert manifolds, and
the statement is the Morse--Palais lemma of Palais (1969).

The proof is Palais's.  Write `f (x + v) - f x - fderiv ℝ f x v = 2⁻¹ * B v v v`, where `B v` is
the **averaged Hessian** `TauCeti.hessianAverage f x v`, the average of the second derivative
along the segment from `x` to `x + v`, weighted so that `B 0` is the Hessian itself.  Then `B` is
a smooth family of symmetric continuous bilinear forms with `B 0` invertible, so
`TauCeti.exists_congruence_of_symmetric_family` produces a smooth family of operators `R v`,
equal to the identity at `v = 0`, with `B v w w' = B 0 (R v w) (R v w')`.  Taking `w = w' = v`
turns the second-order term into the Hessian evaluated at `φ v = R v v`, and `φ` has derivative
the identity at `0`, so it is a chart by the inverse function theorem.

The weight `2 * (1 - t)` is what makes `B 0` the Hessian on the nose.  Iterating the smooth
Hadamard factorisation of `TauCeti.Analysis.Calculus.Hadamard` twice would also produce a smooth
family with `f (x + v) - f x = B v v v` at a critical point, but its value at `0` is then the
derivative of a parametrised integral rather than the Hessian, and it is not symmetric; both are
needed here.  The averaged Hessian and its Taylor formula are stated for a map into an arbitrary
Banach space, nothing in them being special to real-valued functions; only the congruence and the
Morse lemma itself need `f` real-valued.

The family `R` is manufactured from a square root: the operator `C v = (B 0)⁻¹ ∘ B v` is close to
the identity for `v` close to `0`, so it has a unique square root there
(`TauCeti.sqrtNearOne`), and that square root is automatically self-adjoint for the pairing
`B 0`, because the adjoint of a square root is a square root of the adjoint and the two are close
to the identity.  Self-adjointness is exactly what turns `R v * R v = C v` into the congruence
identity.

This is Lane M of the analytic Heegaard Floer roadmap, which asks for Morse homology built the
way Floer homology is built.  The Morse lemma is what makes the local model of a Morse function
available: the index of the critical point, the local handle structure, and the local form of the
gradient flow are all read off it.  Everything here is stated for `C^∞` functions, which is the
standing regularity of Morse theory; the refinement giving a `C^k` chart for a `C^{k+2}` function
is not proved.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.hessianAverage`: the averaged Hessian along a segment, normalised so that
  `TauCeti.hessianAverage_zero` identifies its value at `0` with the Hessian.
* `TauCeti.map_add_eq_add_hessianAverage`: the second-order Taylor formula it satisfies.
* `TauCeti.exists_congruence_of_symmetric_family`: a smooth family of symmetric continuous
  bilinear forms whose value at `0` is invertible is, near `0`, the congruence of that value by a
  smooth family of operators equal to the identity at `0`.
* `TauCeti.IsNondegenerateCriticalPoint.exists_normal_form`: **the Morse lemma**, in the form of a
  smooth map `φ` fixing `0` with derivative the identity there.
* `TauCeti.IsNondegenerateCriticalPoint.exists_morse_chart`: the Morse lemma as a chart at the
  critical point.

/-- A smooth family `B` of symmetric continuous bilinear forms on a Banach space whose value at
`0` is invertible is, near `0`, the congruence of that value by a smooth family of continuous
linear operators equal to the identity at `0`: there is `R` with `R 0 = 1` and
`B₀ (R v w) (R v w') = B v w w'`.

This is the linear-algebraic heart of the Morse lemma, and it is where the square root of an
operator close to the identity is used: the comparison operator `C v = B₀⁻¹ ∘ B v` is
self-adjoint for the pairing `B₀`, hence so is its square root `R v`, hence
`B₀ (R v w) (R v w') = B₀ w ((R v * R v) w') = B₀ w (C v w') = B v w w'`. -/
