# The inverse function theorem with a `C^n` inverse on a whole open set

Mathlib's `ContDiffAt.toOpenPartialHomeomorph` turns a `C^n` map with invertible derivative at a
point into an `OpenPartialHomeomorph`, but `ContDiffAt.to_localInverse` only produces a `C^n`
inverse *at the image point*: `OpenPartialHomeomorph.contDiffAt_symm` needs an invertible
derivative at the point one inverts around, and invertibility is assumed at the base point alone.
Building a partial diffeomorphism of manifolds, or comparing two implicit-function charts of a
level set, needs more: the inverse has to be `C^n` on the whole target.

The invertibility does in fact persist. Mathlib's construction goes through
`ApproximatesLinearOn`: the source of the homeomorphism is an open set on which the map
approximates its derivative `L` at the base point with a constant `c` strictly below `‖L⁻¹‖⁻¹`.
On such a set every Fréchet derivative of the map is within `c` of `L` in norm, hence is still
invertible by `ContinuousLinearMap.isInvertible_of_norm_sub_le_half`. This file extracts that
estimate and runs Mathlib's smooth inverse function theorem at every point of the target.

Two forms are given. The first is about Mathlib's own homeomorphism, over an arbitrary
nontrivially normed field: strict differentiability alone makes derivative invertibility persist,
while inverse `C^n` regularity also assumes the corresponding `C^n` regularity of the map. It is
the form a consumer that cannot choose its homeomorphism — such as the implicit-function chart of
a level set — needs. The second packages the classical statement over `ℝ` or `ℂ`: a `C^n` map with
invertible derivative at a point of an open set `s` restricts to an `OpenPartialHomeomorph` inside
`s` whose inverse is `C^n` on its target.

## Main results

* `ApproximatesLinearOn.norm_sub_le_of_hasFDerivAt`: on a set where `f` approximates `L` with
  constant `c`, every derivative of `f` at an interior point is within `c` of `L`.
* `HasStrictFDerivAt.approximatesLinearOn_toOpenPartialHomeomorph_source`: the source of the
  inverse function theorem's homeomorphism carries the approximation estimate its construction
  chose.
* `HasStrictFDerivAt.isInvertible_of_mem_toOpenPartialHomeomorph_source`: hence the derivative of
  `f` is invertible at every point of that source, not only at the base point.
* `HasStrictFDerivAt.contDiffAt_toOpenPartialHomeomorph_symm` and
  `HasStrictFDerivAt.contDiffOn_toOpenPartialHomeomorph_symm`: the local inverse is `C^n` at every
  point of the target, and hence on the target.
* `TauCeti.ContDiffOn.exists_openPartialHomeomorph`: a `C^n` map (`1 ≤ n`) on an open set with
  invertible derivative at a point restricts to an `OpenPartialHomeomorph` around that point whose
  inverse is `C^n` on the whole target.
