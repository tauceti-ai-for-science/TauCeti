# Circles centred on the real line

For two real points `c₁`, `c₂` of the complex plane, the difference of the two power functions
`|z - c|² - |C - c|²` is affine in the real part of `z` and vanishes when `z.re = C.re`
(`Complex.normSq_sub_ofReal_sub_normSq_sub_ofReal`): the radical axis of two circles centred on
the real line is the vertical line through their intersection points. This file also records the
real points of such a circle and on which side of a second circle its points lie.

## Main results

* `Complex.normSq_sub_ofReal_sub_normSq_sub_ofReal`: the radical-line identity.
* `Complex.norm_sub_eq_of_normSq_sub_eq`: a point at squared distance `ρ ^ 2` is at distance `ρ`.
* `Complex.eq_sub_of_normSq_eq_of_lt_re`, `Complex.eq_add_of_normSq_eq_of_re_lt`: a real point of
  the circle of centre `m` and radius `ρ` is `m - ρ` or `m + ρ`, according to its side.
* `Complex.lt_normSq_sub_of_normSq_eq`: points of one circle on one side of an intersection point
  with a second circle lie strictly outside the second circle.
* `Complex.re_mem_Icc_of_normSq_sub_eq`: the points of the circle of centre `m` and radius `ρ`
  have real part in `[m - ρ, m + ρ]`.
* `Complex.le_normSq_sub_of_le_normSq_sub`: points on or outside one circle, between two of its
  points that lie on or outside a second circle, lie on or outside the second circle.

level sets `|· - m₁|² = r₁` and `|· - m₂|² = r₂`, and let `w` lie on the first, to the left of `a`
and strictly outside the second. Then every point `z` of the first circle to the left of `a` is
