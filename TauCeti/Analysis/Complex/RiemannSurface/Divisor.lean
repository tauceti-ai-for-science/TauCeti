# Pullback of divisors on Riemann surfaces

A finite holomorphic map `f : X → Y` pulls a divisor on `Y` back to `X` by multiplying the
coefficient at `f x` by the local multiplicity of `f` at `x`. The resulting function on `X` has
finite support because `f` has finite fibres. This file packages the construction as the additive
homomorphism `TauCeti.RiemannSurface.divisorPullback` on the existing finite formal sums
`TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.WeilDivisor`.

Pullback is contravariantly functorial. On a point divisor it is the sum of the points in the
fibre, weighted by their local multiplicities, and therefore its divisor degree is the analytic
degree of the map. More generally, pullback multiplies divisor degree by the degree of the finite
holomorphic map. These formulas are the divisor-theoretic form of counting a fibre with
multiplicity and are used to construct ramification divisors.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.RiemannSurface.divisorPullback`: pullback of finite formal divisors by a finite
  holomorphic map.
* `TauCeti.RiemannSurface.coeff_divisorPullback`: the coefficient of the pullback at a point.
* `TauCeti.RiemannSurface.divisorPullback_comp`: pullback reverses composition.
* `TauCeti.RiemannSurface.degree_divisorPullback`: pullback multiplies divisor degree
  by the degree of the map.

## References

* The coefficientwise construction and its API adapt the function-field conorm formalization in
  `TauCeti.FieldTheory.FunctionField.Divisor.Conorm` to finite holomorphic maps.
