# Hyperbolic triangles and the Gauss–Bonnet formula

A hyperbolic triangle with vertices `A`, `B`, `C` in `ℍ` is the intersection of the three closed
half-planes bounded by the geodesic through two of the vertices and containing the third
(`triangle`). Its interior angle at `A` is `interiorAngle A B C`, the angle between the
geodesics from `A` to `B` and from `A` to `C` (defined in `Geodesic/InteriorAngle.lean`). The
**Gauss–Bonnet formula** (`volume_triangle`) computes its invariant area as the angular defect
`π - α - β - γ`.

The point-keyed API lives in the `UpperHalfPlane` namespace: `UpperHalfPlane.closedSide`,
`UpperHalfPlane.triangle`. Membership is read off with
`UpperHalfPlane.mem_closedSide_iff` and `UpperHalfPlane.mem_triangle_iff`. A triangle contains its
vertices (`UpperHalfPlane.left_mem_triangle`), is invariant under cyclic permutation of them
(`UpperHalfPlane.triangle_rotate`) and, when nondegenerate, under every transposition
(`UpperHalfPlane.triangle_swap_left`, `UpperHalfPlane.triangle_swap_right`,
`UpperHalfPlane.triangle_reverse`). An interior angle is the Euclidean angle between any positive
multiples of the two velocities (`interiorAngle_eq_angle_of_velocity_eq`).

Following Katok, the formula is first proved for triangles with a vertex at infinity
(`volume_idealRegion`), and a general triangle is the difference of two such, cut along the
geodesic through one vertex and the point at infinity of the opposite side. We normalise so that
this point at infinity is `∞` itself: the side `AB` lies on the imaginary axis, and `C` lies to
its right (`exists_smul_eq_normal_form`). In this normal form the triangle is described by
three explicit inequalities (`mem_triangle_normal_form_iff`), it differs from `Δ₁ \ Δ₂` by a null
arc (`triangle_subset_diff_union_of_normal_form`), and its three interior angles are read off the
radius vectors of the two semicircles (`interiorAngle_I_geodesicLine_one`,
`interiorAngle_geodesicLine_one_I`, `interiorAngle_of_normal_form`). The comparison of the two
discs uses the radical-line identity `Complex.normSq_sub_ofReal_sub_normSq_sub_ofReal`.
