# Hyperbolic perpendicular bisectors and distance dominance

For two points `p` and `q` of the upper half-plane, the points equidistant from them in the
hyperbolic metric are cut out by the equation `q.im * |z - p|² = p.im * |z - q|²` in the plane.
For distinct centres, the perpendicular bisector has zero invariant area. This is proved in
`TauCeti.Analysis.Complex.UpperHalfPlane.Bisector.Geometry` by identifying the equidistant locus
with a geodesic line.

Likewise, the points at least as close to `p` as to `q` (the distance-dominance, or Voronoi,
region of `p` relative to `q`) are cut out by the weak inequality
`q.im * |z - p|² ≤ p.im * |z - q|²` in the plane. This is the planar form of the defining
inequalities of a Dirichlet domain.

These planar characterizations describe the equality and dominance regions that occur in
Dirichlet domains.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.UpperHalfPlane.dist_eq_dist_iff`: the planar equation of the hyperbolic perpendicular
  bisector.
* `TauCeti.UpperHalfPlane.dist_le_dist_iff`: the planar inequality for the region of points at
  least as close to `p` as to `q`.
