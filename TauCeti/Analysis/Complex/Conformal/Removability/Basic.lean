# Painlevé removability across a line

A line is a removable set for *continuous* holomorphic functions: if `F` is continuous on an open
set `Ω ⊆ ℂ` and holomorphic on `Ω` off a line, then `F` is holomorphic on all of `Ω`. This is the
straight-line base case toward the L4 analytic-arc removability result in the conformal-mapping
roadmap (`ConformalMapping/README.md`); curved analytic arcs remain outside this module's scope.
It is the analytic content that makes the Schwarz reflection principle work, and it is what lets
two functions holomorphic on the two open sides of a line be glued along it as soon as the glued
function is continuous.

The proof is the classical Morera argument. By
`Complex.isConservativeOn_and_continuousOn_iff_isDifferentiableOn`, holomorphy on an open set is
equivalent to continuity together with the vanishing of every rectangle-boundary integral
(`Complex.IsConservativeOn`). Continuity is a hypothesis; for the rectangle integrals we work with
the real axis and split each rectangle there into its part above and its part below. Each half is
bounded by the axis, so its *open interior* misses the axis entirely, where `F` is holomorphic;
Mathlib's continuous-on-closed Cauchy–Goursat lemma
`Complex.integral_boundary_rect_eq_zero_of_continuousOn_of_differentiableOn` then makes each half's
boundary integral vanish, and the shared axis edge cancels when the two halves are recombined. An
arbitrary line is reduced to the real axis by the affine chart `w ↦ p + (q - p) * w`, which is a
biholomorphism of `ℂ` carrying `ℝ` onto the line through `p` and `q`.

In accordance with the conformal-mapping roadmap's generality bar, the results are stated for
scalar-valued functions `F : ℂ → ℂ`, even though the Morera argument and its Mathlib inputs also
support Banach-valued functions. The roadmap deliberately requires every theorem added in layers
L0–L6 to remain scalar; the Banach-valued generalization is therefore outside this module's scope.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.differentiableOn_of_continuousOn_of_differentiableOn_im_ne_zero`: removability of the
  real axis, the base case carrying the Morera argument.
* `TauCeti.differentiableOn_of_continuousOn_of_differentiableOn_im_pos_of_differentiableOn_im_neg`:
  the gluing form — holomorphic above the axis, holomorphic below it, continuous across it, hence
  holomorphic.
* `TauCeti.differentiableOn_of_continuousOn_of_differentiableOn_diff_of_subset_range_lineMap`:
  removability of any subset of the line through two points `p` and `q`, including the singleton
  case `p = q`.
* `TauCeti.differentiableOn_of_continuousOn_of_differentiableOn_diff_im_eq` and
  `TauCeti.differentiableOn_of_continuousOn_of_differentiableOn_diff_re_eq`: the horizontal and
  vertical special cases `{z | z.im = c}` and `{z | z.re = c}`.

The Cauchy foundations consumed here are Mathlib's: the rectangle Cauchy–Goursat theorem
(`Analysis/Complex/CauchyIntegral.lean`) and the disc Morera theorem
(`Analysis/Complex/HasPrimitives.lean`). Layer L4 of the roadmap is absent from the upstream
Mathlib Riemann-mapping effort leanprover-community/mathlib4#33505, so this is new Lean
formalization rather than a shim; any shared foundational API should still be refactored onto
Mathlib's once that human-curated work lands.
