# Area and change of variables for a holomorphic map

Where its derivative does not vanish a holomorphic map is conformal: at such a point `z` it acts on
the plane as a rotation followed by a dilation of ratio `‖deriv f z‖`. At every point, critical or
not, it multiplies infinitesimal area by `‖deriv f z‖ ^ 2`. Integrating that pointwise distortion
over a set on which `f` is injective gives the **area formula**,
`volume (f '' s) = ∫⁻ z in s, ‖deriv f z‖ₑ ^ 2`,
and its immediate corollary that a holomorphic injection whose image has finite area has a finite
Dirichlet integral `∫⁻ z in s, ‖deriv f z‖ₑ ^ 2`.

That finiteness is the analytic input of the *length–area method*, the classical route to layer
**L5** of the conformal-mapping roadmap (`ConformalMapping/README.md`), Carathéodory's boundary
correspondence: for a conformal map of the disc onto a bounded domain, the finite Dirichlet
integral is spent along the circular arcs `{z ∈ ball 0 1 | ‖z - ζ‖ = ρ}` approaching a boundary
point `ζ`, so by Cauchy–Schwarz the images of those arcs must be short for some arbitrarily small
`ρ`, which is what forces the boundary cluster set at `ζ` to degenerate to a point. The topological
half of that argument is already on `main`: `TauCeti.exists_continuousOn_closure_eqOn` turns a
subsingleton cluster set into a continuous extension. The analytic half, of which the area formula
is the first component, is not; the degeneracy itself is not proved here.

Weighting that same distortion by an arbitrary integrand generalises the area formula to the
**change of variables formula** for a holomorphic injection,
`∫⁻ w in f '' s, g w = ∫⁻ z in s, ‖deriv f z‖ₑ ^ 2 * g (f z)`,
of which the area formula is the case `g = 1`. (The area formula is nevertheless kept separate: it
holds for a merely null measurable `s`, while the weight forces the measurability that Mathlib's
change of variables asks for.) The integrability and Bochner forms generalise
`TauCeti.integrableOn_norm_deriv_sq` and `TauCeti.integral_norm_deriv_sq_eq_toReal_volume_image`
the same way, and are stated for an integrand valued in an arbitrary real normed space, as
Mathlib's are.

The proof is Mathlib's change-of-variables formula
`MeasureTheory.lintegral_abs_det_fderiv_eq_addHaar_image₀` for an injective differentiable map,
applied to `f` viewed as a map of the real plane. The only complex-analytic input is the value of
the Jacobian determinant: the `ℝ`-linear map underlying multiplication by `c : ℂ` has determinant
`Complex.normSq c = ‖c‖ ^ 2`, which is the private `det_restrictScalars_smulRight_one` below and
comes from `Algebra.norm_complex_eq` through `LinearMap.det_restrictScalars`. Injectivity is what
makes the formula an equality rather than the inequality
`TauCeti.volume_image_le_lintegral_enorm_deriv_sq`, which holds for any holomorphic map because a
non-injective map covers parts of its image more than once.

In accordance with the generality bar of `ConformalMapping/README.md`, which fixes scalar `ℂ` for
every theorem added in layers L0–L6, the results below are stated for maps of `ℂ`. The hypotheses
are the roadmap's: an open domain `U`, `DifferentiableOn ℂ f U`, and `Set.InjOn`. Statements are
made for an arbitrary `s ⊆ U` rather than for `U` itself, because the length–area argument
integrates over the sub-annuli `U ∩ {z | ρ₁ < ‖z - ζ‖ < ρ₂}`, not over `U`; take `s = U` with
`hUo.measurableSet` and `subset_rfl` for the plain domain form. The area formula and the
finiteness it gives ask only for `MeasureTheory.NullMeasurableSet s volume`, as Mathlib's
null-measurable change of variables does; every other statement below asks for
`MeasurableSet s` — the Bochner-integral forms because that is what turns the continuity of
`deriv f` into strong measurability on `s`, and all three weighted change-of-variables forms
because that is what Mathlib's weighted change of variables asks for.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.volume_image_eq_lintegral_enorm_deriv_sq` — the area formula: the area of the image of
  a set on which a holomorphic map is injective is the integral of `‖deriv f‖ ^ 2` over it.
* `TauCeti.volume_image_le_lintegral_enorm_deriv_sq` — the inequality form, with no injectivity.
* `TauCeti.lintegral_enorm_deriv_sq_ne_top` and `TauCeti.integrableOn_norm_deriv_sq` — a
  holomorphic injection whose image has finite area has a finite Dirichlet integral;
  `TauCeti.lintegral_enorm_deriv_sq_ne_top_of_isBounded` and
  `TauCeti.integrableOn_norm_deriv_sq_of_isBounded` are the forms taking a bounded image.
* `TauCeti.integral_norm_deriv_sq_eq_toReal_volume_image` — the Bochner-integral form of the area
  formula.
* `TauCeti.volume_image_eq_zero_iff` — a holomorphic injection whose derivative is almost
  everywhere nonzero carries null sets to null sets and back.
* `TauCeti.lintegral_enorm_deriv_sq_eq_pi_of_image_eq_ball` — the Dirichlet integral of a Riemann
  map is exactly `π`.
* `TauCeti.lintegral_image_eq_lintegral_enorm_deriv_sq_mul`,
  `TauCeti.integrableOn_image_iff_integrableOn_norm_deriv_sq_smul` and
  `TauCeti.integral_image_eq_integral_norm_deriv_sq_smul` — the change of variables formula for a
  holomorphic injection, in Lebesgue, integrability and Bochner form.

## Coordination with upstream Mathlib

Mathlib has the change-of-variables formula but no area formula for holomorphic maps: a grep of
the pinned Mathlib for `lintegral_abs_det_fderiv` finds only the polar-coordinate and
upper-half-plane applications, neither of which computes the area of a conformal image. Layer L5 is
absent from [mathlib4#33505](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/33505), the
in-progress human-curated Riemann-mapping-theorem effort, which stops at the mapping theorem
itself, so this file is new Lean formalization rather than a temporary shim.

/-- **A holomorphic injection carries null sets to null sets and back.** Where the derivative is
almost everywhere nonzero, the image of a measurable set is null exactly when the set is.

The nonvanishing is not an extra assumption in the intended case `s = U`: a holomorphic map
injective on the open set `U` has nonvanishing derivative throughout `U`, by
`TauCeti.not_injOn_of_deriv_eq_zero`, so `MeasureTheory.ae_restrict_of_forall_mem` supplies `hd`. It
is kept as a hypothesis so that the statement also covers a proper subset `s`, which need not be a
neighbourhood of its points.

Only the forward implication needs the derivative: a differentiable map carries null sets to null
sets whatever its derivative does, whereas a set of positive measure has a null image only if the
area distortion `‖deriv f‖ ^ 2` vanishes on much of it. -/

Taking `g = 1` recovers `TauCeti.volume_image_eq_lintegral_enorm_deriv_sq`; that statement is not
deduced from this one, because it needs `s` only null measurable, while the weight forces the
measurability that Mathlib's `MeasureTheory.lintegral_image_eq_lintegral_abs_det_fderiv_mul`
asks for. -/
