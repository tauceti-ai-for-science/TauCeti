# A proper domain with holomorphic square roots injects holomorphically into the unit disc

The first step of the Riemann mapping theorem: the competing family is nonempty. Every open,
*proper* subset of `ℂ` with holomorphic square roots (`TauCeti.HasHolomorphicSquareRoots`) — in
particular every simply connected one — admits an injective holomorphic map into the open unit
disc.

This is the classical square-root construction. Pick `a ∉ U`. On `U` the nonvanishing function
`z - a` has a holomorphic square root `h`; when `U` is simply connected this is
`TauCeti.exists_differentiableOn_pow_eq` at `n = 2`, constructed as `exp (L / 2)` from the upgraded
holomorphic logarithm branch `L`, not from Mathlib's continuous root branch. Then:

* `h` is injective, since `h z₁ = h z₂` forces `z₁ - a = z₂ - a` after squaring;
* `h '' U` is open (open mapping theorem: `h` is injective, hence nonconstant near each point of
  the open `U`), so it contains a ball `ball w₀ r`;
* `-h z` **avoids** that ball for every `z ∈ U`: otherwise `-h z = h z'`, and squaring gives
  `z' = z`, hence `h z = -h z` and so `h z = 0`, which is impossible;
* therefore `r ≤ ‖h z + w₀‖` throughout `U`.

Inverting, `z ↦ (r/2) / (h z + w₀)` is holomorphic, injective, and bounded by `1/2`. Halving `r`
is what makes the bound **strict**, landing in the open disc rather than its closure.

## Attribution and upstream coordination

Two pieces of prior Mathlib work stand behind this file, both © Yury Kudryashov.

*The construction.* This follows the in-tree Mathlib proof of the same step,
`Complex.exists_mapsTo_unitBall_injOn_deriv_ne_zero` (`Mathlib.Analysis.Complex.RiemannMapping`):
the same plan — pick `a ∉ U`, take a holomorphic square root of `z - a`, obtain an open image ball,
observe that `-h` avoids it, and invert. That lemma is present in this checkout but is **not
exported from its module** (it carries no `public` marker under the module system, so an importer
cannot name it — a direct reference elaborates to `Unknown constant`, while a public lemma from the
same file resolves), which is why this file re-derives the construction rather than reusing it.

*The square root it rests on.* The branch used here comes from
`TauCeti.exists_differentiableOn_pow_eq`, which derives the root as `exp (L / n)` from the
holomorphic upgrade of Mathlib's continuous *logarithm* branch
`Complex.exists_continuousOn_eqOn_exp_comp` (`Mathlib.Analysis.Complex.BranchLogRoot`); Mathlib's
continuous root API `Complex.exists_continuousOn_pow_eq` is not used. The existence half of this
step is therefore Mathlib's; the sibling file `BranchLogRoot.lean` records that debt in detail.

The Riemann mapping theorem is also being formalized upstream at
[mathlib4#33505](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/33505), which proves the
L0–L3 prerequisites internally as private lemmas. This declaration is an explicitly **temporary
shim**: delete it and refactor downstream consumers onto the exported Mathlib version once it lands.

## Main statements

* `TauCeti.exists_differentiableOn_injOn_mapsTo_unitBall` — the nonempty-family step.
* `TauCeti.exists_differentiableOn_injOn_mapsTo_unitBall_apply_eq_zero` — the same step for the
  **normalized** family, whose members fix a chosen base point. This is the form the roadmap's
  maximization argument consumes.

/-- **A holomorphic square root of `z - a`.** On a set `U` with holomorphic square roots and
avoiding `a` the function `z - a` is nonvanishing, so it has a holomorphic square root. Squaring
such a root recovers `z - a`, which pins down `z` because `a` is fixed, so `z ↦ h z ^ 2` is
injective on `U`; and `h` is nonvanishing, because its square is. -/

injective on `U` and `h` is nonvanishing there, and a ball of radius `r` about `w₀` lies inside
`h '' U`, then `-h z` stays outside that ball for every `z ∈ U`: otherwise `-h z = h z'` for some
`z' ∈ U`, and equal squares force `z' = z`, hence `h z = 0`. -/

/-- **The normalized competing family is nonempty.** The roadmap's maximization step ranges over
injective holomorphic maps `U → 𝔻` that *fix a chosen base point* `z₀`, so the nonemptiness it needs
is this one, not the bare version above.

The normalization is the textbook one: post-compose with the disc automorphism centred at
`c = f z₀`, `w ↦ (w - c) / (1 - conj c * w)`. That is the L2 disc-automorphism API of this roadmap,
already available here as `TauCeti.unitDiscMoebius` and its scalar formula, so this step consumes
it rather than substituting a weaker correction:

* holomorphy — `TauCeti.differentiableOn_unitDiscMoebiusFormula_of_norm_lt_one`;
* self-map of `𝔻` — `TauCeti.mapsTo_ball_unitDiscMoebiusFormula_of_norm_lt_one`;
* injectivity on `𝔻` — the factor centred at `-c` is a left inverse
  (`TauCeti.leftInvOn_unitDiscMoebiusFormula_of_norm_lt_one`).

Each is stated for a scalar centre of norm `< 1`, which is exactly what `f z₀ ∈ 𝔻` supplies, so no
passage through the bundled `Complex.UnitDisc` is needed. The Moebius factor is onto `𝔻`, which the
uniqueness half of the Riemann mapping theorem will need; the *nonempty normalized family*
obligation proved here uses only the three properties above. -/

/- **Non-vacuity** (documentation, not public API). The hypotheses above are satisfiable: the open
unit ball has holomorphic square roots (being convex, hence contractible and so simply connected),
and is open and proper. Without this the theorem could be true merely because nothing meets its
hypotheses.  Kept as an `example` — it is a one-off sanity check on `ball 0 1`, with no downstream
consumer, so it should not sit in the public namespace. -/
