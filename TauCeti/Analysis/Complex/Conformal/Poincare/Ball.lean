# Hyperbolic balls of the Poincaré disc are Euclidean discs

The hyperbolic (Poincaré) metric `TauCeti.hyperbolicDist` on the open unit disc is
`Real.artanh` of the pseudo-hyperbolic expression
`p (z, a) = ‖(z - a) / (1 - conj a * z)‖`, and both are visibly non-Euclidean: the metric blows
up at the boundary circle, and `p` is a Moebius quotient rather than a norm. Nevertheless the
hyperbolic ball of radius `R` is the pseudo-hyperbolic ball of radius `Real.tanh R`, and every
pseudo-hyperbolic ball of radius `t ∈ [0, 1)` is a Euclidean disc. This file proves that, with the
centre and radius computed explicitly.

Fix `a` in the disc and a pseudo-hyperbolic radius `t ∈ [0, 1)`. Writing
`D = 1 - t ^ 2 * ‖a‖ ^ 2`, which is positive, put

* `TauCeti.pseudoHyperbolicCenter a t = ((1 - t ^ 2) / D) • a`,
* `TauCeti.pseudoHyperbolicRadius a t = t * (1 - ‖a‖ ^ 2) / D`.

Then `{z ∈ 𝔻 | p (z, a) < t}` is exactly the Euclidean disc of that centre and radius
(`TauCeti.sep_ball_pseudoHyperbolicExpr_lt_eq_ball`), and likewise for `≤` and `=` with the
closed disc and the circle. Substituting `t = Real.tanh R` converts these into statements about
the hyperbolic metric, since `Real.artanh` and `Real.tanh` are inverse increasing bijections
between `(-1, 1)` and `ℝ`: the hyperbolic ball of centre `a` and radius `R` is the Euclidean
disc of centre `pseudoHyperbolicCenter a (Real.tanh R)` and radius
`pseudoHyperbolicRadius a (Real.tanh R)` (`TauCeti.sep_ball_hyperbolicDist_lt_eq_ball`).

## The computation

Everything comes from a single algebraic identity between real quadratics
(`TauCeti.sq_norm_sub_sub_mul_sq_norm_one_sub_conj_mul`):

> `‖z - a‖ ^ 2 - t ^ 2 * ‖1 - conj a * z‖ ^ 2`
> `  = D * (‖z - pseudoHyperbolicCenter a t‖ ^ 2 - pseudoHyperbolicRadius a t ^ 2)`,

valid for every `z : ℂ` as soon as `D ≠ 0`. Expanding the three norms with `Complex.normSq_sub`
turns each side into a real polynomial in `‖z‖`, `‖a‖`, `(z * conj a).re` and `t`, and the two
agree after clearing the denominator `D`. Since `D > 0`,
the left side is negative, zero or positive exactly when `‖z - c‖` is less than, equal to or
greater than the radius, which is the whole content: the pseudo-hyperbolic condition
`‖z - a‖ < t * ‖1 - conj a * z‖` is a Euclidean disc.

Three features of the statement are worth noting. First, the identity — and hence the description
of the sublevel set of `‖z - a‖ - t * ‖1 - conj a * z‖` — needs no hypothesis on `z` at all; it is
only the passage to the *quotient* `p (z, a)` that requires `z` in the disc, so that the Moebius
denominator does not vanish. Second, the resulting Euclidean disc automatically lies inside the
unit disc: `‖c‖ + s < 1` because
`1 - ‖c‖ - s = (1 - ‖a‖) * (1 - t) * (1 - t * ‖a‖) / D`
(`TauCeti.norm_pseudoHyperbolicCenter_add_pseudoHyperbolicRadius_lt_one`). So the restriction to
the disc in the set equalities is a genuine description of a subset of `𝔻`, not an artefact.
Third, each statement asks of the radius only what it uses. The *pointwise* comparisons
(`TauCeti.pseudoHyperbolicExpr_lt_iff_mem_ball` and its `≤`/`=` companions) place no bound on `t`
at all: they assume `0 < D`, which is what turns the identity into a comparison of discs. That is
strictly weaker than `-1 ≤ t ≤ 1`, which implies it (`TauCeti.one_sub_sq_mul_sq_norm_pos`) and is
how every application below discharges it; for `a = 0`, where `D = 1`, every real `t` is allowed.
Positivity of `D` cannot be dropped: for `t < -1` it can fail, and then `s` is positive while the
pseudo-hyperbolic condition is still unsatisfiable. A negative `t` is admitted and is vacuous on
both sides: `p` is nonnegative, so the pseudo-hyperbolic condition is unsatisfiable, and the
Euclidean radius `s` is then negative (`TauCeti.pseudoHyperbolicRadius_neg`), so the Euclidean
disc is empty as well.

The *set-level* statements assume `0 < D` as well, and add to it only an *upper* bound on `t`,
because they describe the intersection with `𝔻` and so need the Euclidean disc to lie inside it.
The endpoint `t = 1` is admitted by the open ball
(`TauCeti.sep_ball_pseudoHyperbolicExpr_lt_eq_ball`, on `t ≤ 1`), where `c = 0` and `s = 1`
and the description degenerates to the statement that `p (·, a) < 1` cuts out all of `𝔻`; the
closed disc and the circle need `t < 1`, since at `t = 1` they would contain the unit circle,
which the pseudo-hyperbolic conditions never reach. No lower bound on `t` is asked for: exactly as
in the pointwise statements, a negative `t` empties both sides. It is this range that makes the
statements about the hyperbolic metric unconditional in `R`, since `Real.tanh R` always lies in
`(-1, 1)` (`TauCeti.one_sub_sq_tanh_mul_sq_norm_pos`).

The Euclidean centre `c` is *not* `a` unless `a = 0` or `t = 0`: a hyperbolic ball is a Euclidean
disc, but an off-centre one, its Euclidean centre pulled towards the origin by the factor
`(1 - t ^ 2) / D`. The hyperbolic centre does lie inside it
(`TauCeti.mem_ball_pseudoHyperbolicCenter`), as it must.

## What this adds

`Poincare/Topology.lean` already identifies the closed hyperbolic ball *about the origin* with a
Euclidean ball (`TauCeti.hyperbolicDist_zero_le_iff_norm_le_tanh`, the case `a = 0`, where the
Moebius denominator is `1` and the computation is immediate) and uses it for properness. The
general centre is what a *local* argument needs, and it is not a formal consequence of the special
case: the disc automorphism moving `a` to the origin is a hyperbolic isometry but not a Euclidean
one. Being a Moebius map it does carry the centred Euclidean disc onto a Euclidean disc — that is
the very fact being proved here — but it preserves neither the Euclidean centre nor the Euclidean
radius, so transport through it still leaves both to be computed. Those transformed values are the
point.

Two immediate consequences are recorded: hyperbolic balls are convex for the *Euclidean* structure
(`TauCeti.convex_sep_ball_hyperbolicDist_lt`), a fact with no hyperbolic proof at this stage of the
development, since geodesic convexity is a different statement; and the balls of the metric space
`TauCeti.PoincareDisc` are characterised in Euclidean terms
(`TauCeti.PoincareDisc.mem_ball_iff`).

## Generality

In accordance with the generality bar of `ConformalMapping/README.md`, which fixes scalar `ℂ` for
every theorem added in layers L0–L6, everything below is stated for `ℂ`. The statements are not
merely specialised but genuinely two-dimensional: the identity above is the complex-analytic
Apollonius computation, and its conclusion — that a Moebius sublevel set is a disc — has no
analogue in a general normed space.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.pseudoHyperbolicCenter` — the Euclidean centre of the pseudo-hyperbolic ball.
* `TauCeti.pseudoHyperbolicRadius` — its Euclidean radius.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.sq_norm_sub_sub_mul_sq_norm_one_sub_conj_mul` — the Apollonius identity the file runs
  on.
* `TauCeti.norm_pseudoHyperbolicCenter_add_pseudoHyperbolicRadius_lt_one`,
  `TauCeti.closedBall_pseudoHyperbolicCenter_subset_ball` and
  `TauCeti.ball_pseudoHyperbolicCenter_subset_ball` — the Euclidean disc lies inside `𝔻`.
* `TauCeti.pseudoHyperbolicExpr_lt_iff_mem_ball`,
  `TauCeti.pseudoHyperbolicExpr_le_iff_mem_closedBall` and
  `TauCeti.pseudoHyperbolicExpr_eq_iff_mem_sphere` — the pointwise form.
* `TauCeti.sep_ball_pseudoHyperbolicExpr_lt_eq_ball`,
  `TauCeti.sep_ball_pseudoHyperbolicExpr_le_eq_closedBall` and
  `TauCeti.sep_ball_pseudoHyperbolicExpr_eq_eq_sphere` — pseudo-hyperbolic balls, closed balls and
  circles are Euclidean ones.
* `TauCeti.sep_ball_hyperbolicDist_lt_eq_ball`,
  `TauCeti.sep_ball_hyperbolicDist_le_eq_closedBall` and
  `TauCeti.sep_ball_hyperbolicDist_eq_eq_sphere` — the same for the hyperbolic metric, with
  `t = Real.tanh R`.
* `TauCeti.PoincareDisc.mem_ball_iff`, `TauCeti.PoincareDisc.mem_closedBall_iff` and
  `TauCeti.PoincareDisc.mem_sphere_iff` — the balls, closed balls and spheres of the Poincaré
  metric space, read on the Euclidean disc.

This carries the conformal-mapping roadmap's L2 target "the hyperbolic / Poincaré metric on `𝔻`"
(see `ConformalMapping/README.md`) onto its metric geometry, completing the basic ball API of that
metric. As with the rest of the L0–L3 conformal-mapping material it is coordinated with the
upstream Mathlib Riemann mapping effort leanprover-community/mathlib4#33505, which contains the
preceding human-curated work along with `Analysis/Complex/RiemannMapping.lean` and
`Analysis/Complex/BranchLogRoot.lean`; none of that material describes the hyperbolic metric on
the disc.

The closest formal precedent anywhere is Mathlib's *upper half-plane* model,
`Mathlib/Analysis/Complex/UpperHalfPlane/Metric.lean`, which does carry the analogous ball
description, and whose API shape the development below follows: `UpperHalfPlane.center z r` is
the Euclidean centre of the hyperbolic ball of centre `z` and radius `r`,
`UpperHalfPlane.cmp_dist_eq_cmp_dist_coe_center` and its consequences
`UpperHalfPlane.dist_lt_iff_dist_coe_center_lt`,
`UpperHalfPlane.dist_le_iff_dist_coe_center_le` and
`UpperHalfPlane.dist_eq_iff_dist_coe_center_eq` are the pointwise comparisons, and
`UpperHalfPlane.image_coe_ball`, `UpperHalfPlane.image_coe_closedBall` and
`UpperHalfPlane.image_coe_sphere` are the set-level identifications. What is supplied here is the
disc-model counterpart: the two models are conformally but not Euclidean-equivalent, so the
formulas differ (`z.im * Real.cosh r` and `z.im * Real.sinh r` on `ℍ`, against
`TauCeti.pseudoHyperbolicCenter` and `TauCeti.pseudoHyperbolicRadius` here), and Mathlib has no
metric on `𝔻` to state them about. Nothing here duplicates that file; the parallel is one of
shape, and it is what fixes the shape of the API below.

/-! ### Pseudo-hyperbolic balls are Euclidean discs -/

/-- **The pseudo-hyperbolic ball is a Euclidean disc.** A point `z` of the unit disc satisfies
`pseudoHyperbolicExpr z a < t` exactly when it lies in the Euclidean disc of centre
`TauCeti.pseudoHyperbolicCenter a t` and radius `TauCeti.pseudoHyperbolicRadius a t`.

Clearing the Moebius denominator — legitimate because `z` and `a` lie in the disc — turns the
left-hand condition into `‖z - a‖ < t * ‖1 - conj a * z‖`, and squaring both sides makes
`TauCeti.sq_norm_sub_sub_mul_sq_norm_one_sub_conj_mul` applicable; the factor
`1 - t ^ 2 * ‖a‖ ^ 2` it produces is positive by hypothesis, so it does not affect the sign.

Positivity of that factor is all that is asked of `t`; it holds in particular for every
`t ∈ [-1, 1]` (`TauCeti.one_sub_sq_mul_sq_norm_pos`), and for every real `t` when `a = 0`. A
negative `t` is allowed and makes both sides empty, the Euclidean radius being negative. -/
