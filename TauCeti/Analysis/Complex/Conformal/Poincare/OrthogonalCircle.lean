# Poincaré geodesics are Euclidean circles orthogonal to the unit circle

`Conformal/Poincare/Geodesic.lean` builds the unit-speed geodesic lines of the Poincaré disc,
`TauCeti.PoincareDisc.geodesicLine a u`, as the radial geodesics `t ↦ u * Real.tanh t` carried
off the origin by a Moebius isometry, and `Conformal/Poincare/Betweenness.lean` shows that these
are *all* the geodesic lines. What neither says is what a geodesic looks like in the *Euclidean*
plane away from the origin: through the origin it is a diameter, and off the origin it is the
classical arc of a circle meeting the unit circle at right angles. This file proves that, and its
converse: the diameters and those arcs are **exactly** the geodesics.

The route is to read "lies on the geodesic through `a` in direction `u`" as an equation. Applying
the Moebius isometry that sends `a` to the origin turns it into "lies on a diameter", which is
the reality of `conj u * z`; pulling that back through `z ↦ (z - a) / (1 - conj a * z)` and
clearing the denominator gives the equation

`Im (conj u * (z - a) * (1 - a * conj z)) = 0`,

and `TauCeti.im_conj_mul_sub_mul_one_sub_mul_conj` rearranges it into the shape of a Euclidean
circle equation, `Im (B * z) = A * (‖z‖ ^ 2 + 1)` with `A = Im (conj u * a)` and
`B = conj u - u * conj a ^ 2`. The coefficient of `‖z‖ ^ 2` and the constant term are *equal*,
and that is exactly orthogonality to the unit circle: completing the square in that equation
gives the circle of centre `c = TauCeti.orthogonalCircleCenter u a` and radius
`R = TauCeti.orthogonalCircleRadius u a`, which satisfy `‖c‖ ^ 2 = R ^ 2 + 1`, the Pythagorean
relation saying that the tangent length from `c` to the unit circle is `R`. That relation, and
the positivity of the radius, come from the identity

`‖B‖ ^ 2 - 4 * A ^ 2 = ‖u‖ ^ 2 * (1 - ‖a‖ ^ 2) ^ 2`

(`TauCeti.normSq_sub_mul_conj_sq_sub_four_mul_sq_im`); reading it at `‖u‖ = 1`, together with
`‖a‖ < 1`, is where those two hypotheses enter. The degenerate case `A = 0` is exactly the case in
which the geodesic passes through the origin, and then the equation collapses to the Euclidean
diameter `Im (conj u * z) = 0`.

## The converse

Reading the same computation backwards realises a *prescribed* circle. Every circle orthogonal to
the unit circle meets the ray through its centre at a point `k * w` of the open disc — the near
point, at distance `k = ‖c‖ - R` from the origin, which the orthogonality relation identifies with
`1 / (‖c‖ + R) < 1` — and the hyperbolic line through that point perpendicular to the ray has
centre `((1 + k ^ 2) / (2 * k)) * w` and radius `(1 - k ^ 2) / (2 * k)`
(`TauCeti.orthogonalCircleCenter_I_mul_ofReal_mul`,
`TauCeti.orthogonalCircleRadius_I_mul_ofReal_mul`). The orthogonality relation is exactly what
makes those two numbers `‖c‖` and `R` again, so the prescribed circle is the circle of that line
(`TauCeti.exists_orthogonalCircleCenter_eq_orthogonalCircleRadius_eq`). Together with the
diameters, which the radial geodesics already trace, this closes the description into an iff.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.PoincareDisc.mem_range_radialGeodesic_iff` — a point of the Poincaré disc lies on the
  radial geodesic in direction `u` exactly when `conj u * z` is real.
* `TauCeti.PoincareDisc.mem_range_geodesicLine_iff` — the equation of the geodesic line through
  `a` in direction `u`, and
  `TauCeti.PoincareDisc.toPoincare_zero_mem_range_geodesicLine_iff` — that equation at the origin,
  which is what makes `Im (conj u * a)` the geometric discriminator of the case split below.
* `TauCeti.orthogonalCircleCenter` and `TauCeti.orthogonalCircleRadius` — the centre and radius
  parameters read off by completing the square, which for `‖u‖ = 1`, `‖a‖ < 1` and
  `Im (conj u * a) ≠ 0` are the centre and radius of the Euclidean circle traced by a hyperbolic
  line missing the origin, together with `TauCeti.orthogonalCircleRadius_pos` and the
  orthogonality relation `TauCeti.norm_orthogonalCircleCenter_sq`.
* `TauCeti.PoincareDisc.range_coe_toUnitDisc_geodesicLine_eq_ball_inter_sphere` — a geodesic line
  missing the origin traces `ball 0 1 ∩ sphere c R` for that Euclidean circle, which is
  **orthogonal to the unit circle**, `‖c‖ ^ 2 = R ^ 2 + 1`, and the complementary case
  `TauCeti.PoincareDisc.range_coe_toUnitDisc_geodesicLine_eq_ball_inter_setOf_im` — a geodesic
  line through the origin traces the Euclidean diameter in its direction, of which
  `TauCeti.PoincareDisc.range_coe_toUnitDisc_radialGeodesic_eq` is the reading at the base
  point `0`.
* `TauCeti.PoincareDisc.range_coe_toUnitDisc_geodesicLine_eq_ball_inter_or` — the two cases
  together: every geodesic line of the Poincaré disc traces the intersection of the disc with a
  Euclidean line through the origin or with a Euclidean circle orthogonal to the unit circle.
* `TauCeti.PoincareDisc.range_coe_toUnitDisc_eq_ball_inter_or_of_isometry` — the same for an
  arbitrary isometric embedding of the real line, which is the parametrisation-free form of that
  description.
* `TauCeti.orthogonalCircleCenter_I_mul_ofReal_mul` and
  `TauCeti.orthogonalCircleRadius_I_mul_ofReal_mul` — the two parameters at the perpendicular pair
  `u = I * w`, `a = k * w` for a unit vector `w`, which for `k` in `Ioo 0 1` are the centre and
  radius of the hyperbolic line through `k * w` perpendicular to the radius through `w`, and
  `TauCeti.exists_orthogonalCircleCenter_eq_orthogonalCircleRadius_eq` — every circle orthogonal to
  the unit circle is the circle of a hyperbolic line.
* `TauCeti.PoincareDisc.exists_range_coe_toUnitDisc_geodesicLine_eq_ball_inter_sphere` — the
  converse direction in the circular case: every arc `ball 0 1 ∩ sphere c R` with `0 < R` and
  `‖c‖ ^ 2 = R ^ 2 + 1` is traced by a geodesic. The converse for the diameters needs nothing new,
  `TauCeti.PoincareDisc.range_coe_toUnitDisc_radialGeodesic_eq` being already an equality of sets.
* `TauCeti.PoincareDisc.exists_range_coe_toUnitDisc_geodesicLine_eq_iff` and
  `TauCeti.PoincareDisc.exists_isometry_range_coe_toUnitDisc_eq_iff` — **the classification**: the
  traces of the geodesics of the Poincaré disc are exactly the Euclidean diameters and the arcs of
  Euclidean circles orthogonal to the unit circle, in the parametrised and parametrisation-free
  readings.

## Generality

In accordance with the generality bar of `ConformalMapping/README.md`, which fixes scalar `ℂ`
for layers L0--L6, everything is stated for the complex unit disc. The plane-geometry lemmas of
the first section ask nothing of `a` beyond `‖a‖ < 1` and nothing of `u` beyond `‖u‖ = 1` — and
several of them ask less: the discriminant identity is homogeneous in `u` and needs no hypothesis
at all, and the degenerate case needs only `‖a‖ ≠ 1`. They are stated for bare complex numbers so
that they can be reused off the `PoincareDisc` synonym.

## Coordination with upstream Mathlib

This is L2 material, "the hyperbolic / Poincaré metric on `𝔻`" of
`TauCetiRoadmap/ConformalMapping/README.md`, and as such falls under that roadmap's coordination
clause for the in-progress human-curated Riemann-mapping effort
[mathlib4#33505](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/33505): it should be
refactored onto upstream API if that work lands a Poincaré-disc geometry. The pinned Mathlib has
the hyperbolic metric on the upper half-plane (`Analysis/Complex/UpperHalfPlane`) but no
Poincaré metric on the disc and no description of its geodesics; nothing is vendored here.

/-! ## The equation of a hyperbolic line in the plane -/

/-- **The geodesic equation is a Euclidean circle equation.** The quantity
`Im (conj u * (z - a) * (1 - a * conj z))`, which cuts out the hyperbolic line through `a` in
direction `u`, is `Im (B * z) - A * (‖z‖ ^ 2 + 1)` for `A = Im (conj u * a)` and
`B = conj u - u * conj a ^ 2`.

The point of the rearrangement is that the coefficient of `‖z‖ ^ 2` and the constant term are the
same number `A`. For `A ≠ 0` an equation `A * ‖z‖ ^ 2 - Im (B * z) + C = 0` describes a circle,
and that circle is orthogonal to the unit circle exactly when `A = C`, so for `A ≠ 0` the geodesic
equation *is* the equation of such a circle (`TauCeti.setOf_im_eq_ball_inter_sphere`). For `A = 0`
it is not a circle equation at all: it is linear, and describes a Euclidean line through the
origin (`TauCeti.setOf_im_eq_ball_inter_setOf_im`). No hypothesis is needed for the rearrangement
itself: this is an identity of real numbers. -/

/-- **The discriminant identity behind the radius.** The linear coefficient `B` and the quadratic
coefficient `A` of the geodesic equation (`TauCeti.im_conj_mul_sub_mul_one_sub_mul_conj`) satisfy
`‖B‖ ^ 2 - 4 * A ^ 2 = ‖u‖ ^ 2 * (1 - ‖a‖ ^ 2) ^ 2`. Both sides are homogeneous of degree two in
`u`, so no normalisation of `u` is needed; at `‖u‖ = 1` the right-hand side is `(1 - ‖a‖ ^ 2) ^ 2`.

Completing the square turns the geodesic equation into `‖z - c‖ ^ 2 = ‖c‖ ^ 2 - 1` with
`‖c‖ ^ 2 = ‖B‖ ^ 2 / (4 * A ^ 2)`, so this identity is what makes the radius
`(1 - ‖a‖ ^ 2) / (2 * |A|)` positive when `‖u‖ = 1` and `‖a‖ < 1`: the circle is a genuine circle
and not a point or the empty set. -/

/-! ### The centre and radius of the orthogonal circle -/

/-- The centre parameter `c = I * conj B / (2 * A)`, with `A = Im (conj u * a)` and
`B = conj u - u * conj a ^ 2`, read off by completing the square in the geodesic equation
`Im (B * z) = A * (‖z‖ ^ 2 + 1)` of `TauCeti.im_conj_mul_sub_mul_one_sub_mul_conj`.

Nothing is asked of `u` or `a` here, so on its own this is an algebraic parameter: at `A = 0` the
division is by zero and the value is `0`, and `A ≠ 0` alone does not make it the centre of a
genuine circle, since the companion radius `TauCeti.orthogonalCircleRadius u a` vanishes at
`‖a‖ = 1` and is negative beyond. It is the centre of the Euclidean circle traced by the
hyperbolic line through `a` in direction `u` under the hypotheses `‖u‖ = 1`, `‖a‖ < 1` and
`A ≠ 0` of `TauCeti.setOf_im_eq_ball_inter_sphere`, the last of which says that that line misses
the origin. -/

/-- The quantity `R = (1 - ‖a‖ ^ 2) / (2 * |A|)`, with `A = Im (conj u * a)`, read off by
completing the square as in `TauCeti.orthogonalCircleCenter`.

Nothing is asked of `u` or `a` here, so this is a signed algebraic parameter: at `A = 0` the
division is by zero and the value is `0`, and for `A ≠ 0` it is negative for `‖a‖ > 1` (at
`u = 1` and `a = 2 * I` it is `-3/4`). Under `‖a‖ < 1` and `A ≠ 0` it is positive
(`TauCeti.orthogonalCircleRadius_pos`), but it is the radius of the Euclidean circle traced by the
hyperbolic line through `a` in direction `u` only once `‖u‖ = 1` as well
(`TauCeti.setOf_im_eq_ball_inter_sphere`): unlike the centre, `R` is not invariant under
rescaling `u`, because `A` scales with `u` while the numerator does not. -/

direction `u` misses the origin, and positivity is then what makes the Euclidean set that line
traces a genuine circle rather than a point or the empty set
(`TauCeti.setOf_im_eq_ball_inter_sphere`). -/

bound on `‖a‖`.

Once `‖a‖ < 1` makes `R` positive (`TauCeti.orthogonalCircleRadius_pos`), so that the circle of
centre `c` and radius `R` is a genuine circle, the relation is Pythagoras for the right triangle
whose legs are the radius `1` of the unit circle and the radius `R`, and it then says precisely
that the two circles meet at right angles. -/

/-! ### Realising a prescribed orthogonal circle

The lemmas above read off the circle of a given hyperbolic line. This section runs the other way:
it exhibits, for a prescribed circle orthogonal to the unit circle, a base point and a direction
whose circle it is. The base point is the point of the circle nearest the origin and the direction
is perpendicular to the radius through it, so the pair to compute with is `a = k * w`,
`u = I * w` for a unit vector `w` and a real `k`; that is the normal form the lemmas below
treat. -/

/-- The discriminator `Im (conj u * a)` of `TauCeti.setOf_im_eq_ball_inter_sphere` at the
perpendicular pair `u = I * w`, `a = k * w` with `‖w‖ = 1` and `k` real: it is `-k`.

Nothing is asked of `k` beyond being real, so on its own this is an algebraic identity. For
`|k| < 1`, which is exactly when `k * w` lies in the open unit disc, it reads geometrically: the
hyperbolic line through `k * w` perpendicular to the radius through `w` misses the origin exactly
when `k ≠ 0`. -/

centre parameter of `u = I * w`, `a = k * w` is `((1 + k ^ 2) / (2 * k)) * w`, again on the radius
through `w`.

As at `TauCeti.orthogonalCircleCenter` itself, nothing is asked of `k`, so on its own this is an
algebraic computation: at `k = 0` the two sides are the two divisions by zero, both `0`. It is
exactly for `0 < |k| < 1` that `k * w` lies in the open unit disc away from the origin, and for
`0 < k < 1` the value is the centre of the Euclidean circle traced by the hyperbolic line through
`k * w` in the direction `I * w` perpendicular to the radius through `w`. That reading, together
with `TauCeti.orthogonalCircleRadius_I_mul_ofReal_mul`, is the computation that makes every circle
orthogonal to the unit circle a hyperbolic line: as `k` ranges over `Ioo 0 1` the centre sweeps
out the whole ray beyond the unit circle. -/

/-- **The radius parameter at the perpendicular pair.** The companion of
`TauCeti.orthogonalCircleCenter_I_mul_ofReal_mul`: for a unit `w` and any real `k`, the radius
parameter of `u = I * w`, `a = k * w` is `(1 - k ^ 2) / (2 * |k|)`. Unlike the centre, which is a
signed expression in `Im (conj u * a)`, the radius divides by `2 * |Im (conj u * a)| = 2 * |k|`,
whence the absolute value; for `0 < k` it reads `(1 - k ^ 2) / (2 * k)`, and at `k = 0` both sides
are the division by zero, `0`.

Positivity of the value is the further information `0 < |k| < 1`, that is, that `k * w` lies in
the open disc away from the origin; at `k = 0` the value is `0` and for `|k| > 1` it is negative,
so neither describes a circle. It is under `0 < k < 1` that this is the radius of the Euclidean
circle traced by the hyperbolic line through `k * w` in the direction `I * w`. -/

/-- **The geodesics of the Poincaré disc, parametrisation-free.** A subset of the plane is traced
by *some* isometric embedding of the real line into the Poincaré disc — a geodesic, with no
reference to `TauCeti.PoincareDisc.geodesicLine` — exactly when it is the intersection of the open
unit disc with a Euclidean line through the origin or with a Euclidean circle orthogonal to the
unit circle.

This is `TauCeti.PoincareDisc.exists_range_coe_toUnitDisc_geodesicLine_eq_iff` freed of the
parametrisation, the two readings agreeing because every isometric embedding of the line is a
`geodesicLine` (`TauCeti.PoincareDisc.existsUnique_eq_geodesicLine`) and every `geodesicLine` is
an isometric embedding (`TauCeti.PoincareDisc.isometry_geodesicLine`). -/
