# Betweenness in the Poincaré disc: the hyperbolic geodesic is unique

`Poincare/Geodesic.lean` shows that the Poincaré disc is a **geodesic** metric space: the
Euclidean diameters, reparametrised by `Real.tanh`, are unit-speed geodesic lines, and moving one
of them by a disc automorphism joins any prescribed pair of points. It leaves open the converse —
that these are the *only* geodesics — and it is the converse that this file supplies.

Everything follows from one betweenness criterion, which says that the *hyperbolic* segment issued
from the origin is the *Euclidean* radius:

`hyperbolicDist 0 m + hyperbolicDist m w = hyperbolicDist 0 w ↔ m ∈ segment ℝ 0 w`.

The implication `←` is `TauCeti.hyperbolicDist_zero_add_hyperbolicDist_ofReal_mul`, already proved
in `Poincare/Geodesic.lean`. The implication `→` is the new content, and it comes from the
*equality case* of a triangle inequality. Writing `A = ‖m‖`, `B = ‖w‖` and `ρ` for the
pseudo-hyperbolic expression `TauCeti.pseudoHyperbolicExpr m w`, the addition formula for
`Real.artanh` turns the hypothesis into `(A + ρ) / (1 + A ρ) = B`, hence into
`ρ = |A - B| / (1 - A B)`: the reverse pseudo-hyperbolic triangle inequality against the origin,
`TauCeti.abs_sub_div_one_sub_mul_le_pseudoHyperbolicExpr_of_norm_lt_one`, is *tight*. Its equality
case (proved in `Hyperbolic/Triangle.lean` from the Poincaré defect factorisation) says that this
happens exactly when `(m * conj w).re = ‖m‖ * ‖w‖`, and that — with `A ≤ B`, which the
nonnegativity of `ρ` forces — is exactly the statement that `m` lies on the Euclidean radius
towards `w`. The mirror equality case, for the origin sitting in the *middle* rather than at an
end, is proved the same way and identifies `(z * conj w).re = -(‖z‖ * ‖w‖)` with
`0 ∈ segment ℝ z w`.

Both of those last identifications are Euclidean, not hyperbolic, and hold in any real inner
product space: `(z * conj w).re` is the real inner product of `ℂ` (`Complex.inner`), and the
criteria are `TauCeti.mem_segment_zero_left_iff_real_inner_eq_norm_mul_and_norm_le` and
`TauCeti.zero_mem_segment_iff_real_inner_eq_neg_norm_mul` of
`TauCeti/Analysis/Convex/Segment.lean`, consumed here through that one translation.

Three geometric consequences follow, in increasing strength:

* a point at prescribed distance from `z` on a hyperbolic segment from `z` to `w` is **unique**,
  which is the Menger-convexity statement `Poincare/Geodesic.lean` proved only in its existence
  half;
* two unit-speed geodesics with the same pair of endpoints **agree** on the parameter interval
  between them — the Poincaré disc is *uniquely* geodesic;
* every unit-speed geodesic *line* through the origin **is** a radial one,
  `TauCeti.PoincareDisc.radialGeodesic u` for a unique direction `u : Circle`, which is the
  converse classification `Poincare/Geodesic.lean` explicitly left unproved.

The general case of a geodesic through an arbitrary point needs no separate argument: the disc
automorphisms act transitively by isometries (`TauCeti.PoincareDisc.unitDiscMoebiusIsometryEquiv`),
which is exactly how the betweenness criterion is transported off the origin in
`TauCeti.PoincareDisc.eq_of_dist_add_dist_eq`. `TauCeti.PoincareDisc.existsUnique_eq_geodesicLine`
records that transport for the classification itself, dropping the hypothesis that the line starts
at the origin: it is the origin statement applied to
`fun t => unitDiscMoebiusIsometryEquiv (toUnitDisc (γ 0)) (γ t)`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.hyperbolicDist_zero_add_eq_iff_of_norm_lt_one` — the hyperbolic segment from the origin
  is the Euclidean radius.
* `TauCeti.hyperbolicDist_add_zero_eq_iff_of_norm_lt_one` — the origin is hyperbolically between
  two points exactly when it is Euclidean-between them.
* `TauCeti.PoincareDisc.eq_of_dist_add_dist_eq` — a point between `z` and `w` is determined by its
  distance to `z`.
* `TauCeti.PoincareDisc.existsUnique_dist_eq_of_mem_Icc` — the unique-Menger-convexity upgrade of
  `TauCeti.PoincareDisc.exists_dist_eq_of_mem_Icc`.
* `TauCeti.PoincareDisc.eqOn_Icc_of_isometry` — **the Poincaré disc is uniquely geodesic**.
* `TauCeti.PoincareDisc.existsUnique_eq_radialGeodesic` — **every geodesic line through the
  origin is a Euclidean diameter**, for a unique direction.
* `TauCeti.PoincareDisc.existsUnique_eq_geodesicLine` — the same statement with no restriction on
  the base point: every geodesic line is `TauCeti.PoincareDisc.geodesicLine (γ 0) u` for a unique
  direction.

This advances the conformal-mapping roadmap's L2 target "the hyperbolic / Poincaré metric on `𝔻`"
(see `ConformalMapping/README.md`), completing the geodesic description that
`Poincare/Geodesic.lean` began. It reuses Tau Ceti's pseudo-hyperbolic, hyperbolic-distance and
disc-automorphism API throughout, and `TauCeti/Analysis/Convex/Segment.lean` — itself built on
Mathlib's `segment` and `SameRay` — for the Euclidean side.
As with the rest of the L0--L3 conformal-mapping material it is coordinated with the upstream
Mathlib Riemann-mapping effort leanprover-community/mathlib4#33505 and the preceding
human-curated work in `Analysis/Complex/RiemannMapping.lean` and
`Analysis/Complex/BranchLogRoot.lean`; none of that
material contains a Poincaré metric on the disc, and Mathlib's hyperbolic geometry on the upper
half-plane (`Analysis/Complex/UpperHalfPlane`) has no geodesics, so nothing here duplicates it.
Should a human-curated Poincaré disc land upstream, this file should be refactored onto it.

/-! ### Euclidean segments through the origin, in terms of `(z * conj w).re`

The two criteria of this section are the statements of `TauCeti/Analysis/Convex/Segment.lean` —
which hold in any real inner product space — transcribed into the Hermitian language `ℂ` supplies
for its own inner product. They stay private: the exported statements of this file are the
hyperbolic ones below. -/

/-- The real part of the Hermitian product of two complex numbers is their real inner product: `ℂ`
carries the real inner product `⟪w, z⟫ = (z * conj w).re` (`Complex.inner`), which is symmetric.
This is the only translation the Euclidean criteria need in order to apply here. -/
private lemma re_mul_conj_eq_real_inner (z w : ℂ) : (z * (starRingEnd ℂ) w).re = ⟪z, w⟫ := by
  rw [← _root_.Complex.inner w z, real_inner_comm]

/-- A point of the Euclidean segment from `0` to `w` is a real multiple `t • w` with `t ∈ [0, 1]`,
and conversely. A repackaging of Mathlib's `segment_eq_image_lineMap` at the left endpoint `0`, in
the shape in which the hyperbolic statements below consume it. -/
private lemma mem_segment_zero_left_iff :
    m ∈ segment ℝ 0 w ↔ ∃ t ∈ Icc (0 : ℝ) 1, m = (t : ℂ) * w := by
  rw [segment_eq_image_lineMap]
  simp only [mem_image, AffineMap.lineMap_apply_module, smul_zero, zero_add, Complex.real_smul]
  exact exists_congr fun _ => and_congr_right fun _ => eq_comm

/-- **Membership in the Euclidean radius, read off the Hermitian product.** A point `m` lies on the
segment from `0` to `w` exactly when `m` and `w` point in the same direction — equality in the
Cauchy--Schwarz inequality, `Complex.abs_re_le_norm` for `m * conj w` — and `m` is no further from
the origin than `w` is.

Both conditions are needed: `2 * w` points in the direction of `w` without lying on the segment.

This is `TauCeti.mem_segment_zero_left_iff_real_inner_eq_norm_mul_and_norm_le` read through
`Complex.inner`. -/
private lemma mem_segment_zero_left_iff_re_mul_conj :

/-- **The origin lies between two points exactly when their Hermitian product is negative real.**
This is the mirror of `TauCeti.mem_segment_zero_left_iff_re_mul_conj`, for the origin at the
middle of a Euclidean segment rather than at one of its ends: it is
`TauCeti.zero_mem_segment_iff_real_inner_eq_neg_norm_mul` read through `Complex.inner`. -/
private lemma zero_mem_segment_iff_re_mul_conj :
    (0 : ℂ) ∈ segment ℝ z w ↔ (z * (starRingEnd ℂ) w).re = -(‖z‖ * ‖w‖) := by
  rw [re_mul_conj_eq_real_inner, zero_mem_segment_iff_real_inner_eq_neg_norm_mul]

/-! ### Hyperbolic betweenness -/

/-- **The hyperbolic segment issued from the origin is the Euclidean radius.** A point `m` of the
disc satisfies `hyperbolicDist 0 m + hyperbolicDist m w = hyperbolicDist 0 w` — it is
hyperbolically between the origin and `w` — exactly when it lies on the Euclidean segment from `0`
to `w`.

The implication `←` is `TauCeti.hyperbolicDist_zero_add_hyperbolicDist_ofReal_mul`. For `→`, the
addition formula `Real.artanh_add` and the injectivity of `Real.artanh` on `Ioo (-1) 1` turn the
hypothesis into `(‖m‖ + ρ) / (1 + ‖m‖ ρ) = ‖w‖`, hence into `ρ (1 - ‖m‖ ‖w‖) = ‖w‖ - ‖m‖`, where
`ρ = pseudoHyperbolicExpr m w`; that is the equality case
`TauCeti.pseudoHyperbolicExpr_eq_abs_sub_div_one_sub_mul_iff_of_norm_lt_one` of the reverse
pseudo-hyperbolic triangle inequality, and `ρ ≥ 0` supplies `‖m‖ ≤ ‖w‖`. -/

/-- **Every geodesic line through the origin is a Euclidean diameter.** This is the converse to
`TauCeti.PoincareDisc.isometry_radialGeodesic`, and it completes the description of the geodesics
of the Poincaré disc: an isometric embedding of the real line sending `0` to the origin *is* one of
the radial geodesics `TauCeti.PoincareDisc.radialGeodesic u`.

On the nonnegative half-line the hypothesis places `γ t` and `γ 1` on a common Euclidean radius —
whichever of the two is nearer the origin lies on the segment towards the other — so `γ t` is a
nonnegative multiple of `γ 1`, and its norm is pinned to `Real.tanh t` by its distance to the
origin. On the negative half-line the origin is *between* `γ t` and `γ (-t)`, which by
`TauCeti.hyperbolicDist_add_zero_eq_iff_of_norm_lt_one` puts the two on opposite radii, at equal
distance from the origin; so `γ t = -γ (-t)`, and `Real.tanh` is odd.

The direction is unique: evaluating `radialGeodesic u = radialGeodesic v` at time `1` gives
`u * Real.tanh 1 = v * Real.tanh 1`, and `Real.tanh 1 ≠ 0` because `Real.tanh` is injective. In
particular `u ↦ radialGeodesic u` is injective, so distinct directions give distinct lines. -/

/-- **Every geodesic line of the Poincaré disc is a `TauCeti.PoincareDisc.geodesicLine`.** This
removes the restriction to the origin from `TauCeti.PoincareDisc.existsUnique_eq_radialGeodesic`:
an isometric embedding `γ` of the real line is `geodesicLine (γ 0) u` for one and only one
direction `u : Circle`, with no hypothesis on where it starts.

As the introduction says, the general case needs no separate argument. The composite
`fun t => unitDiscMoebiusIsometryEquiv (toUnitDisc (γ 0)) (γ t)` is again an isometric embedding
and now sends `0` to the origin, so the origin case applies to it; undoing that Moebius isometry
turns its conclusion into the statement here. -/
