# The Schwarz reflection principle across a circle

This file proves the circle case of the Schwarz reflection principle. A continuous function
holomorphic on one side of a circle and taking that circle into another circle extends across the
source circle by conjugating it with the two circle inversions. The extension is holomorphic
wherever the reflected branch avoids the target centre.

The analytic gluing step is Painlevé removability for a circle, supplied by
`Conformal/Removability/Circle.lean`. This is the Möbius-reduction route specified by layer L4 of
the conformal-mapping roadmap.

The construction follows Ahlfors, *Complex Analysis*, Chapters 4--6. It reuses Mathlib's
topological piecewise API and Euclidean inversion, together with Tau Ceti's line-removability and
circle-reflection conjugation theorems. Layer L4 is absent from the upstream Mathlib
Riemann-mapping draft mathlib4#33505.

/-- **Schwarz reflection principle across a circle.** Let `Ω` be an open set invariant under
reflection in the source circle. If `f` is continuous on the closed inside part, holomorphic on
the open inside part, sends the source-circle boundary into the
target circle, and avoids the target centre in the punctured interior, then its explicit
circle-reflection extension is holomorphic throughout `Ω`.

The target-centre avoidance is exactly the non-pole condition for reflection in the target
circle. -/
