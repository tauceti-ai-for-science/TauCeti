# The endpoints of a circular crosscut

For a point `ζ` on `sphere c r` and a radius `ρ` with `0 < ρ < 2 * r`, the circle
`sphere ζ ρ` cuts the disc `ball c r` in one open arc. This file identifies that arc, its closed
companion, and its two endpoints exactly. If

* `α = arg (c - ζ)` is the direction from `ζ` to the centre, and
* `φ = arccos (ρ / (2 * r))` is the half-angle of the crosscut,

then the open and closed arcs are the images under `circleMap ζ ρ` of `(α - φ, α + φ)` and
`[α - φ, α + φ]`, while the two bounding circles meet at the images of the endpoints. Since
`φ < π / 2`, a crosscut spans less than a half turn, and the chord length along it is therefore
unimodal about any one of its points; that is what makes a crosscut *locally connected at its own
endpoints*, the last statement below.

This is the source-side endpoint interface needed by layer **L5** of
`TauCetiRoadmap/ConformalMapping/README.md`, the Jordan-domain case of Carathéodory boundary
correspondence. `Conformal/ShortCrosscut.lean` makes the image of the *open* arc arbitrarily short,
and `Conformal/CutDiameter.lean` asks local connectedness of the image boundary to join the two
ends by a small boundary set. The results here name those two ends and package the open arc together
with its closure; they do not assert the continuous boundary extension itself.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.arccos_div_two_mul_pos` and `TauCeti.arccos_div_two_mul_lt_pi_div_two` bound the
  half-angle: it is positive, and below `π / 2`. These two facts are the standing hypotheses of
  almost every argument along a crosscut — they are what make the angular window nondegenerate and
  shorter than a period — and every crosscut file routes through them rather than re-deriving them
  from `Real.arccos_pos` and `Real.arccos_lt_pi_div_two`.
* `TauCeti.ball_inter_sphere_eq_circleMap_image_Ioo` and
  `TauCeti.closedBall_inter_sphere_eq_circleMap_image_Icc` identify the open and closed crosscut
  arcs.
* `TauCeti.sphere_inter_sphere_eq_pair_circleMap` identifies their two distinct endpoints.
* `TauCeti.isPathConnected_ball_inter_sphere` and
  `TauCeti.closure_ball_inter_sphere` give the corresponding topological packaging, and
  `TauCeti.nonempty_frontier_ball_inter_closure_ball_inter_sphere` records that a crosscut reaches
  the frontier of the disc.
* `TauCeti.isPreconnected_ball_inter_sphere_inter_ball` — a ball centred at a point of the closed
  crosscut meets the crosscut in a subarc: a crosscut spans less than a half turn, so along it the
  chord distance to a fixed one of its points falls and then rises, and the angles it keeps below a
  threshold form an interval. That last step is
  `TauCeti.ordConnected_inter_setOf_dist_circleMap_lt` and the chord length it runs on is measured
  by `TauCeti.dist_circleMap_eq_two_mul_abs_sin`; both live in
  `TauCeti/Topology/Circle/Metric.lean`, since neither mentions the disc. This is the
  local connectedness of a crosscut at its own endpoints,
  which `Conformal/Crosscut/Image.lean` spends to make the cluster set of a conformal map at an end
  of an image crosscut a continuum.

The half-width `arccos (ρ / (2 * r))` is read off the cosine criterion of
`TauCeti/Topology/Circle/Metric.lean` through `Real.lt_cos_iff_mem_Ioo` and
`Real.le_cos_iff_mem_Icc`, the arccosine description of the angles at which the cosine exceeds a
threshold, in `TauCeti/Analysis/SpecialFunctions/Trigonometric/Arccos.lean`.

## Coordination with upstream Mathlib

Layer L5 is absent from
[mathlib4#33505](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/33505), the in-progress
human-curated Riemann-mapping-theorem effort. Mathlib supplies `circleMap`, its periodicity and
injectivity on one period, inverse trigonometric functions, and the generic fact that two circles in
the plane meet in at most two points; none of the crosscut descriptions below is present there.

/-! ## The half-angle -/

/-- **The half-angle of a genuine circular crosscut is positive**, so the crosscut occupies a
nondegenerate arc of angles. This is `Real.arccos_pos` at `ρ / (2 * r)`, the argument being below
`1` exactly because `ρ < 2 * r`. -/
theorem arccos_div_two_mul_pos (hr : 0 < r) (hρr : ρ < 2 * r) :
    0 < Real.arccos (ρ / (2 * r)) :=
  Real.arccos_pos.mpr ((div_lt_one (by linarith)).mpr hρr)

/-- **A genuine circular crosscut spans less than a half turn**: its half-angle is below `π / 2`.
This is `Real.arccos_lt_pi_div_two` at `ρ / (2 * r)`, the argument being positive exactly because
`0 < ρ`.

The bound is what makes the chord distance along a crosscut unimodal
(`TauCeti.isPreconnected_ball_inter_sphere_inter_ball`) and what keeps the closed arc of angles
inside one period, so that `TauCeti.circleMap` is injective on it. -/

This is the general criterion `TauCeti.circleMap_mem_closedBall_iff_sq` at `dist ζ c = r`, where
the two squared radii cancel and the surviving condition
`ρ ^ 2 ≤ 2 * ρ * r * cos (θ - arg (c - ζ))` may be divided by `ρ > 0`. -/
