# Geometry of the complex slit plane

The quotient `z₂ / z₁` of two points of an open half-plane through the origin is never a
nonpositive real, so it lies in `Complex.slitPlane`. The half-plane is encoded by a normal
direction `a`: its members are the `z` with `0 < (conj a * z).re`. Specializations to the
four axis-aligned half-planes cover the common cases.

The module also records a locally uniform lower bound for the distance from a point of the slit
plane to the closed negative half-axis. This bound locally dominates slit-plane kernels and thus
supports differentiation and holomorphy arguments for parameter-dependent Stieltjes integrals.

These criteria feed logarithm evaluations of index integrals: a curve piece confined to a
half-plane about the winding point has slit-compatible chord ratios, so its index integral
is a principal logarithm.

/-- The ratio of two members of an open half-plane through the origin lies in the slit
plane. The half-plane with normal direction `a` is `{z | 0 < (conj a * z).re}`; degenerate
`a` admits no members, so no nonvanishing hypothesis is needed. -/
