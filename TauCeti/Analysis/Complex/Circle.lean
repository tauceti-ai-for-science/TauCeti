# The unit circle is the unit sphere of `ℂ`

Mathlib's unit circle `Circle` is a type synonym for the unit sphere `sphere (0 : ℂ) 1`, carrying
its group structure.  This file records the identification as a homeomorphism, so that results
stated for unit spheres of real normed spaces (such as their CW structures) apply to `Circle`
without unfolding the synonym.

## Main declarations

* `Circle.homeomorphSphere`: `Circle ≃ₜ sphere (0 : ℂ) 1`, the identity on underlying complex
  numbers.
