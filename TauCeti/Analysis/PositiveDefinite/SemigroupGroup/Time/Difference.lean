# Time differences of bounded semigroup-group positive-definite functions

This file proves the alternating finite-difference property needed for the existence half of the
Berg--Christensen--Ressel representation theorem. If `F` is bounded and positive definite on the
involutive semigroup `ℝ≥0 × V`, then every iterated time difference built from

`(t, v) ↦ F (t, v) - F (t + h, v)`

is again positive definite.

The argument uses the canonical Kolmogorov decomposition of the BCR kernel. For any finite linear
combination of feature vectors, translating every time coordinate by `s` gives a vector `w s` whose
Gram function depends only on the sum of the two translation parameters. Its diagonal values form
a bounded nonnegative log-convex sequence along any arithmetic progression. Such a sequence is
decreasing, which is exactly positivity of the time difference.

Applying Bochner's theorem to those differences makes the corresponding alternating differences
of the spatial Bochner measures positive, the time-regularity input required to assemble the BCR
representing measure.

An iterated time difference expands into the alternating binomial sum
`(t, v) ↦ ∑ k ≤ n, (-1) ^ k (n choose k) F (t + k • h, v)`, so that sum is positive definite too.
Positive definiteness is a statement about quadratic forms, not a pointwise sign: nonnegativity of
the values themselves is asserted only along the zero-spatial axis, where it becomes the classical
complete monotonicity of `t ↦ F (t, 0)` in the finite-difference sense. Those one-variable
statements are read off the differences built here in
`TauCeti/Analysis/PositiveDefinite/SemigroupGroup/Time/Axis.lean`.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.timeDifference`: the one-step alternating time difference, the negative of Mathlib's
  forward difference `fwdDiff` applied in the time coordinate.
* `TauCeti.listTimeDifference`: the alternating difference along a finite list of time steps, and
  `TauCeti.iteratedTimeDifference`: its equal-step specialization.
* `TauCeti.iteratedTimeDifference_eq_alternating_sum`: the binomial expansion of an iterated time
  difference.
* `TauCeti.IsSemigroupGroupPD.timeDifference`: a bounded BCR-positive-definite function remains
  positive definite after subtracting a nonnegative forward time translate.
* `TauCeti.IsSemigroupGroupPD.listTimeDifference` and
  `TauCeti.IsSemigroupGroupPD.iteratedTimeDifference`: every alternating time difference of a
  bounded BCR-positive-definite function, along arbitrary or repeated steps, is positive definite,
  and `TauCeti.IsSemigroupGroupPD.alternating_sum` says the same in binomial form.
* `TauCeti.isBounded_range_listTimeDifference` and
  `TauCeti.isBounded_range_iteratedTimeDifference`: those differences stay bounded, so they can be
  differenced again.
* `TauCeti.continuous_listTimeDifference` and `TauCeti.continuous_iteratedTimeDifference`: those
  differences stay continuous, so Bochner's theorem applies to each of their time slices.
