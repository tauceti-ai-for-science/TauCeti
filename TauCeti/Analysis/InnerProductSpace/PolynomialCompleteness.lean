# Completeness of an orthogonal polynomial system from moment determinacy

`TauCeti.hilbertBasisOfWeightedMeasure` assembles a `HilbertBasis` of `L²(w·μ)` from an
orthogonality relation *and* a completeness hypothesis `(span …)ᗮ = ⊥`, but nothing in the library
discharges that hypothesis. This file supplies it for a family of polynomials of exact degree,
the case every classical orthogonal family falls under.

The mechanism is moment determinacy. If the weighted measure `w·μ` carries one finite
exponential moment then `TauCeti.ae_eq_zero_of_forall_moment_eq_zero_of_exists_integrable_exp`
says a `g ∈ L²(w·μ)` orthogonal to every *monomial* vanishes. So the only thing completeness needs
of the family is that it **spans `ℝ[X]`**, and that is the hypothesis the core theorem takes.

Exact degrees are one sufficient route to spanning, not the content of the argument: a family with
`(p n).degree = n` spans, because over a field every nonzero leading coefficient is a unit
(`Polynomial.Sequence.span`). That case is kept as a corollary, since it is the one every classical
orthogonal family satisfies. Requiring `degree` rather than `natDegree` matters there:
`natDegree 0 = 0` would admit `p 0 = 0`, which silently destroys the basis.

## Main statements

* `TauCeti.memLp_two_algebraMap_eval` — polynomials lie in `L²` of a measure carrying one finite
  exponential moment, via `TauCeti.integrable_pow_of_exp_moment`.
* `TauCeti.memLp_two_bareNormalized` — the normalized-family `MemLp` obligation, discharged from
  that same exponential moment so callers need not repeat it.
* `TauCeti.orthogonal_span_range_bareNormalizedLp_eq_bot_of_span_eq_top` — the completeness input
  of the B2 bridge, from spanning alone.
* `TauCeti.orthogonal_span_range_bareNormalizedLp_eq_bot` — its exact-degree specialization.

/-- **Roadmap B1 → B2 bridge: completeness of a spanning polynomial family.**

If the weighted measure `w·μ` carries one finite exponential moment and `p` spans `ℝ[X]`, then the
normalized polynomials span a dense subspace of `L²(w·μ)` — the orthogonal complement of their span
is trivial. This is the `hcomplete` input that `TauCeti.hilbertBasisOfWeightedMeasure` consumes.

Spanning is all the argument uses; see
`TauCeti.orthogonal_span_range_bareNormalizedLp_eq_bot` for the exact-degree families that motivate
it. -/
