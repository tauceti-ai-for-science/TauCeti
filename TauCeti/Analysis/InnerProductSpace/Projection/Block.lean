# Diagonal and off-diagonal blocks of an operator

Let `U` be a submodule of an inner product space `E` admitting an orthogonal projection `P_U`.
Relative to the orthogonal decomposition `E = U ⊕ Uᗮ`, a bounded operator `A` on `E` is a
`2 × 2` block operator. Its *diagonal part* `U.diagBlock A = P_U A P_U + P_{Uᗮ} A P_{Uᗮ}` keeps
the `U → U` and `Uᗮ → Uᗮ` blocks, and its *off-diagonal part*
`U.offDiagBlock A = P_U A P_{Uᗮ} + P_{Uᗮ} A P_U` keeps the `Uᗮ → U` and `U → Uᗮ` blocks.

Both parts are expressed through the reflection `R_U = 2 P_U - 1` across `U`: conjugating by
`R_U` fixes the diagonal blocks and negates the off-diagonal ones, so the two parts are the
average and the half-difference of `A` and `R_U A R_U`. Since `R_U` is an isometry, these
formulas turn operator-norm estimates for `A` into estimates for its blocks.

## Main definitions

* `Submodule.diagBlock U A`: the block-diagonal part of `A` relative to `U ⊕ Uᗮ`.
* `Submodule.offDiagBlock U A`: the off-diagonal part of `A` relative to `U ⊕ Uᗮ`.

## Main results

* `Submodule.diagBlock_add_offDiagBlock`: the two parts sum to `A`.
* `Submodule.diagBlock_diagBlock`, `Submodule.offDiagBlock_offDiagBlock`,
  `Submodule.diagBlock_offDiagBlock`, `Submodule.offDiagBlock_diagBlock`: taking either part is
  idempotent, and each part annihilates the other.
* `Submodule.two_smul_diagBlock`: `2 • U.diagBlock A = A + R_U A R_U`.
* `Submodule.two_smul_offDiagBlock`: `2 • U.offDiagBlock A = A - R_U A R_U`.
* `Submodule.commute_reflection_iff`: `R_U` commutes with `A` exactly when `P_U` does.
* `Submodule.offDiagBlock_eq_zero_iff`, `Submodule.diagBlock_eq_self_iff`: `A` is block
  diagonal exactly when `P_U` commutes with `A`.
