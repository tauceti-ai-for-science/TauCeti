# The gap between two subspaces

For submodules `U` and `V` of an inner product space admitting orthogonal projections `P_U` and
`P_V`, the *gap* between `U` and `V` is the operator norm `‖P_U - P_V‖`, and the *directed gap*
from `U` to `V` is `‖P_{Vᗮ} P_U‖`, which measures how far vectors of `U` of norm at most one can
stick out of `V`. The gap is symmetric, bounded by `1`, and vanishes exactly when `U = V`; it is
the quantity in which perturbation bounds for spectral subspaces are stated.

The main result is the sharp identity
`‖P_U - P_V‖ = max ‖P_{Vᗮ} P_U‖ ‖P_{Uᗮ} P_V‖`, with no completeness or dimension hypothesis.
It reduces gap estimates to estimates of the two directed gaps, and identifies the gap as a
measure of how far each subspace sticks out of the other.

## Main definitions

* `Submodule.projectionGap U V`: the gap `‖P_U - P_V‖`.
* `Submodule.directedProjectionGap U V`: the directed gap `‖P_{Vᗮ} P_U‖`.

## Main results

* `Submodule.projectionGap_comm`: the gap is symmetric.
* `Submodule.directedProjectionGap_le_projectionGap`: each directed gap is at most the gap.
* `Submodule.projectionGap_eq_max`: the gap is the larger of the two directed gaps.
* `Submodule.directedProjectionGap_eq_zero_iff`: the directed gap from `U` to `V` vanishes
  exactly when `U ≤ V`; consequently `Submodule.projectionGap_eq_zero_iff`.
