# Continuous subharmonic functions

Let `E` be a finite-dimensional real inner product space with its volume measure. This file
defines continuous subharmonic functions `u : E → ℝ` on a set `U` by the local sub-mean-value
inequality: `u` is continuous on `U`, and at every `x ∈ U` the value `u x` is at most the average
of `u` over `ball x r` for arbitrarily small radii `r > 0`. No differentiability is assumed, so
the class is closed under pointwise maxima, which is what Perron's method for the Dirichlet
problem needs.

The main result is the **comparison principle**: a subharmonic function on a bounded open set
`U` that lies below a harmonic function `h` on `frontier U`, both continuous on `closure U`, lies
below `h` on all of `closure U`. Applied to balls, it shows that the definition used here implies
the one of Gilbarg–Trudinger, Section 2.8: a subharmonic function lies below every harmonic
function that dominates it on the boundary sphere of a ball. The proof reduces to the maximum
principle for the sub-mean-value property on a compact superlevel set
(`IsCompact.exists_mem_frontier_isMaxOn_of_le_setAverage_ball`).

The comparison principle also holds between a subharmonic function `u` and a *superharmonic*
function `w` (one with `-w` subharmonic): if `u ≤ w` on `frontier U`, both continuous on
`closure U`, then `u ≤ w` on `closure U`. This is the form needed to compare members of the Perron
family with upper barriers.
