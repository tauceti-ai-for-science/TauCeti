# The half-disc boundary contour

For `0 < R`, the boundary of the upper half-disc of radius `R` about the origin, traversed
counterclockwise on `[-R, R + π]`: the diameter along the real axis from `-R` to `R`, followed by
the semicircular arc from `R` back to `-R`, the arc carrying its angle in `t - R`.

Its distinguishing feature is that it passes **through** the origin rather than detouring around
it, so the origin is an on-curve point and the generalized winding number there is `½` — the value
strictly between the exterior `0` and the interior `1`:

* the diameter contributes `0`: the index integrand `1 / t` is odd, so its principal value over
  the symmetric interval vanishes (`windingNumber_eq_zero_segment`);
* the arc contributes `½`: it is a half-circle about its own centre, so its winding is its angular
  extent `π / 2π` (`windingNumber_circleMap_center_eq_half`).

That `½` is exactly the hypothesis of the Hungerbühler–Wasem half-residue theorem
`hasCauchyPV_half_residue`, which is why this contour is the one HW's motivating example uses: a
Cauchy principal value along the real axis with a simple pole at the origin, where the classical
residue theorem does not apply because the pole lies *on* the contour.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.Contour.halfDiscBoundary` — the contour, with `halfDiscBoundary_of_le` and
  `halfDiscBoundary_of_lt` evaluating its two branches and `halfDiscBoundary_left`,
  `halfDiscBoundary_right` its endpoints (equal, so the contour is closed).
* `TauCeti.Contour.continuous_halfDiscBoundary` — the two branches agree at the junction, so the
  contour is continuous.
* `TauCeti.Contour.isPwC1ImmersionOn_halfDiscBoundary` — it is a piecewise-`C¹` immersion, with
  the single breakpoint `R`; this is the regularity hypothesis of the Hungerbühler–Wasem theorems.
* `TauCeti.Contour.windingNumber_halfDiscBoundary` — its generalized winding number about the
  origin is `½`.
* `TauCeti.Contour.halfDiscBoundary_eq_zero_iff` — the contour meets the origin exactly once,
  at `t = 0`.
* `TauCeti.Contour.halfDiscBoundary_im_eq_zero_or_norm_eq`,
  `TauCeti.Contour.im_halfDiscBoundary_nonneg`, and `TauCeti.Contour.norm_halfDiscBoundary_le` —
  the contour lies in the closed upper half-disc on its parameter interval, with
  `TauCeti.Contour.norm_halfDiscBoundary_eq` pinning the arc to the circle itself.
* `TauCeti.Contour.halfDiscBoundary_ne_of_im_pos_of_norm_lt` — the contour avoids the open upper
  half-disc.
* `TauCeti.Contour.deriv_halfDiscBoundary_of_lt_radius` and
  `TauCeti.Contour.deriv_halfDiscBoundary_of_lt` — before the junction the derivative is the real
  inclusion's, beyond it the circle map's at the shifted parameter.
* `TauCeti.Contour.integral_halfDiscBoundary_arc` — the `[R, R + π]` piece of the contour integral
  is the `circleMap 0 R` integral over `[0, π]`; for `0 < R` that is the upper semicircle, the
  form Jordan's lemma bounds.
* `TauCeti.Contour.flatOfOrder_halfDiscBoundary` — both one-sided branches at the origin lie on
  the real line, so the contour is flat there to every order.
* `TauCeti.Contour.conditionAprime_halfDiscBoundary` — Hungerbühler–Wasem condition (A′) at the
  origin, for any integrand.

/-- **The arc piece of the contour integral is the circle-map integral.** Beyond the junction the
half-disc boundary is the circle map shifted by `R`, so translating the parameter identifies the
`[R, R + π]` piece of `∮_γ f` with the integral of `circleMap 0 R` over `[0, π]`. The junction
`t = R` itself, where the contour has a corner, is a single point and does not affect the integral.

The identity holds for every `R`. For `0 < R` the right-hand side is the *upper* semicircle
traversed counterclockwise — the form Jordan's lemma bounds; for `R < 0` the same parametrization
traces the lower semicircle instead, and `R = 0` is degenerate, `circleMap 0 0` being the constant
path at the origin. -/
