# Norm bound and decay at infinity of Dixon's `dixonH2`

For `w` outside a ball containing the curve, Dixon's Cauchy-type integral
`dixonH2 f γ a b w = ∫ t in a..b, f (γ t) / (γ t - w) * deriv γ t` is small and tends to `0` as
`‖w‖ → ∞`. The distance lower bound `‖w‖ - R ≤ ‖γ t - w‖` (for `‖γ‖ ≤ R < ‖w‖`) controls the Cauchy
kernel; the numerator `f (γ ·) * deriv γ` is then bounded either uniformly or in `L¹`:

* with a uniform bound `M` on the integrand, `‖dixonH2 f γ a b w‖ ≤ M / (‖w‖ - R) · |b - a|`;
* using only interval-integrability of the weight (rewrite the integrand as
  `(γ t - w)⁻¹ * (f (γ t) * deriv γ t)`),
  `‖dixonH2 f γ a b w‖ ≤ (∫ ‖f (γ ·) * deriv γ‖) / (‖w‖ - R)`.

The two hypotheses are incomparable — the uniform bound needs no integrability, the `L¹` bound needs
no uniform bound — so both are kept. The `L¹` form is what applies to raw curves whose derivative is
only interval-integrable.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.Contour.dixonH2_norm_le` / `dixonH2_tendsto_zero` — the uniform-bound norm estimate and
  its decay at infinity.
* `TauCeti.Contour.dixonH2_norm_le_of_integrable` / `dixonH2_tendsto_zero_of_integrable` — the `L¹`
  versions, via the shared estimate `norm_integral_inv_sub_mul_le`.

The decay of `dixonH2` (hence of Dixon's glued function, which agrees with it far out) is the input
to the Liouville step of Dixon's proof of the homology form of Cauchy's theorem
(`homologyCauchyTheorem`, `TauCetiRoadmap/ContourIntegration/Suggested.lean`).

## Provenance

Adapted from `dixonH2_norm_le` and `dixonH2_tendsto_zero` in `DixonTheorem.lean` of the AINTLIB
`LeanModularForms` development, restated for a raw `γ : ℝ → ℂ` on an oriented interval (the
`|b - a|` factor is the interval length, invisible in the `[0, 1]`-parametrised original). The `L¹`
variants additionally shed the boundedness hypothesis, bounding by `∫ ‖f (γ ·) * deriv γ‖` instead.

`w` with `R < ‖w‖`, then `F` tends to `0` along `cocompact ℂ`: outside a large closed ball the bound
drops below any `ε > 0`. Shared scaffolding for the uniform and `L¹` decay lemmas below. -/

`f (γ ·) * deriv γ` is interval-integrable, `dixonH2` is bounded by that weight's `L¹` norm divided
by `‖w‖ - R`. Unlike `dixonH2_norm_le` this needs no uniform bound on the integrand, so it applies
to raw curves whose derivative is only interval-integrable: rewrite the integrand as
`(γ t - w)⁻¹ * (f (γ t) * deriv γ t)` and apply `norm_integral_inv_sub_mul_le`. Only the bound on
the half-open interval `Ι a b` is needed. -/
