# A segment crossing a set once has its ends on different sides

A closed set `K ⊆ ℂ` with `K \ {p}` preconnected, crossed once by a straight segment at `p` with
`K` adherent from both sides, separates the two ends into different connected components of `Kᶜ`.
The proof uses winding numbers and needs no Jordan curve theorem.

This is the planar-separation input for layer L5 of the `ConformalMapping` roadmap.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.Contour.notMem_connectedComponentIn_compl_of_isPreconnected_sdiff_singleton` — **the
  two ends of the segment lie in different components of `Kᶜ`.**
* `TauCeti.Contour.mem_filledHull_or_mem_filledHull_of_isPreconnected_sdiff_singleton` — **for
  bounded `K`, one end lies in the filled hull.**

/-- **A segment crossing a set once has its ends in different components of the complement.**
Let `K` be closed with `K \ {p}` preconnected, crossed by a straight segment at an interior point
`p = v · s + z₀` with `K` adherent from both sides of the segment. Then the two endpoints
`v · a + z₀` and `v · b + z₀` lie in different connected components of `Kᶜ`. -/
