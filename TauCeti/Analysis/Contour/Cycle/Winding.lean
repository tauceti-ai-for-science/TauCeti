# Winding numbers of contour cycles off their trace

The generalized winding number of a contour cycle is defined at every point by additive extension
from its closed piecewise-`C¹` generators. Away from the cycle's trace, every generator is in the
classical regime: its principal value is an ordinary integral and its winding number is an integer.
This file transfers that classical package to finite formal `ℤ`-combinations of curves.

The support formula is the bridge between the free-abelian-group definition and the single-curve
theory. It gives the ordinary contour-integral formula and integer-valuedness off the trace. It also
shows that the cycle winding number is locally constant on the trace complement, vanishes far from
the cycle, and hence vanishes on every unbounded connected component of the complement.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.Contour.Cycle.windingNumber_eq_integral_of_not_mem_trace` identifies the winding number
  off the trace with the normalized ordinary cycle integral of the Cauchy kernel.
* `TauCeti.Contour.Cycle.exists_int_windingNumber_of_not_mem_trace` proves integer-valuedness off
  the trace.
* `TauCeti.Contour.Cycle.isLocallyConstant_windingNumber` proves local constancy on the trace
  complement.
* `TauCeti.Contour.Cycle.windingNumber_eq_zero_of_unbounded_component` proves vanishing on every
  unbounded component of the complement.

/-- **A per-generator splitting resums to the cycle-level one.** Summing, over the generators of a
cycle and weighted by their coefficients, an integral of `g` plus `c` times a `w`-weighted sum of
that generator's winding numbers gives the cycle integral of `g` plus `c` times the `w`-weighted
sum of the *cycle's* winding numbers.

The scalar `c`, the integrand `g` and the weight `w` are all arbitrary; residue applications take
`c = 2πi`. At `S = ∅` both sides collapse to `integral g C`, and at `c = 0` to the same. -/
