# Cycles of piecewise-`C¹` curves

A contour cycle is a finite formal `ℤ`-linear combination of closed piecewise-`C¹` curves. This
file packages that definition as the free abelian group on parametrized closed curves and extends
the contour integral and winding number additively from curves to cycles.

Individual curves remain functions on real intervals, as elsewhere in the contour library. The
small `PiecewiseC1ClosedCurve` bundle exists only because `FreeAbelianGroup` needs a type of
generators; it records exactly an interval-restricted function, its oriented parameter interval,
its regularity, and its closedness. Its canonical extension to `ℝ` lets existing raw-function
contour results apply directly. In particular, it does not introduce a second notion of contour
integral.

The geometric trace of a cycle is the union of the images of the generators with nonzero
coefficient. Thus cancellation removes a curve from the trace, just as it removes that curve's
contribution to every additive invariant.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.Contour.PiecewiseC1ClosedCurve` — a closed piecewise-`C¹` parametrized curve.
* `TauCeti.Contour.Cycle` — the free abelian group on such curves.
* `TauCeti.Contour.Cycle.trace` — the geometric trace of a cycle.
* `TauCeti.Contour.Cycle.integral` — the additive extension of the contour integral.
* `TauCeti.Contour.Cycle.windingNumber` — the additive extension of the winding number.
* `TauCeti.Contour.Cycle.IsIn` and `TauCeti.Contour.Cycle.IsNullHomologous` — the cycle-level
  domain and null-homology predicates.
