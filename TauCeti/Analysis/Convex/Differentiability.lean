# Differentiability of extended-real convex functions

A convex function `f : E → EReal` is one whose real epigraph `{(x, r) | f x ≤ r}` is convex, the
convention of `TauCeti.convex_epigraph_fenchelConjugate`; Legendre–Fenchel conjugates are the
basic examples. This file connects such functions to Mathlib's real-valued convexity and
differentiability theory.

The effective-domain and real-representative convexity bridges are in
`TauCeti.Analysis.Convex.EffectiveDomain`. In finite dimension, Rademacher's theorem for convex
functions applies: at almost every point of the effective domain, `f` is finite on a
neighbourhood and the real representative
is differentiable (`TauCeti.ae_eventually_ne_top_and_differentiableAt_toReal`). This is the
almost-everywhere differentiability of convex potentials used to turn optimal plans into
transport maps, as in Brenier's theorem.

At such a point the subdifferential of `f` for a pairing `B` reduces to the derivative:
every subgradient `y` satisfies `D f (x) v = B v y` for all `v`
(`TauCeti.hasFDerivAt_apply_eq_of_mem_subdifferential`). This needs neither convexity nor finite
dimension. On a real inner product space, with the inner product as pairing, the subgradient is
then the gradient (`TauCeti.hasGradientAt_toReal_of_mem_subdifferential`): this is how the
gradient of a convex potential becomes a transport map. Conversely, for a convex `f` the
derivative at any point of the effective domain where the real representative is differentiable
is a subgradient (`TauCeti.mem_subdifferential_of_hasFDerivAt`), since a convex function of one
variable lies above its tangent lines; this is how the gradient of a convex potential is shown to
be an optimal transport map.

## Main statements

* `TauCeti.ae_eventually_ne_top_and_differentiableAt_toReal` — **Rademacher's theorem for
  extended-real convex functions**: at almost every point of the effective domain, `f` is finite
  nearby and differentiable;
* `TauCeti.hasFDerivAt_apply_eq_of_mem_subdifferential` and
  `TauCeti.fderiv_apply_eq_of_mem_subdifferential` — at an interior point of the effective
  domain where `f` is differentiable, every subgradient is the derivative;
* `TauCeti.hasGradientAt_toReal_of_mem_subdifferential` and
  `TauCeti.gradient_toReal_eq_of_mem_subdifferential` — the same statement for the inner product,
  where every subgradient is the gradient;
* `TauCeti.mem_subdifferential_of_hasFDerivAt` and `TauCeti.gradient_toReal_mem_subdifferential`
  — for a convex function, the derivative, respectively the gradient, at a point of
  differentiability in the effective domain is a subgradient.
