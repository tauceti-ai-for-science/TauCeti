# The Aleksandrov Monge–Ampère measure of a convex function

Let `E` be a finite-dimensional real inner product space with an additive Haar measure `μ`, and
let `f : E → EReal` be convex (convex real epigraph, never `⊥`), with `D` the interior of its
effective domain `{x | f x ≠ ⊤}`. The *subgradient image* of a set `s` is
`∂f(s) = ⋃ x ∈ s, ∂f(x)` (`TauCeti.subgradientImage`), the union of the subdifferentials of `f`
for the inner product. The *Aleksandrov Monge–Ampère measure* of `f` is

  `MA_f(s) = μ(∂f(s ∩ D))`

for Borel `s`. It gives the weak (Aleksandrov) sense in which a merely convex function solves
the Monge–Ampère equation `det D²f = ν`. The same formula defines a measure for every `μ`
absolutely continuous with respect to a Haar measure, such as the weighted measure
`s ↦ ∫_{∂f(s ∩ D)} g` for `μ = volume.withDensity g`.

That `s ↦ μ(∂f(s ∩ D))` is a measure rests on two facts.

* A point `y` that is a subgradient at two distinct points `x₁ ≠ x₂` is a point where the
  conjugate `f⋆` has the two subgradients `x₁` and `x₂`, so `f⋆` is not differentiable there.
  By Rademacher's theorem for the convex function `f⋆`, such points form a `μ`-null set
  (`TauCeti.measure_setOf_exists_ne_mem_subdifferential_eq_zero`); this needs no convexity of `f`.
  Hence the subgradient images of disjoint sets are almost disjoint.
* The subgradient image of a compact subset of `D` is compact
  (`TauCeti.isCompact_subgradientImage`). Open subsets of `D` are σ-compact, so their
  subgradient images are measurable; complements are handled by the almost-disjointness, so the
  subgradient image of every Borel subset of `D` is null measurable
  (`TauCeti.nullMeasurableSet_subgradientImage`).

A finite convex function `u` on an open convex set `Ω` is covered by extending it by `⊤` off `Ω`;
then `D = Ω` and the subdifferential is the set of `y` with `u x + ⟪x' - x, y⟫ ≤ u x'` for all
`x' ∈ Ω` (`TauCeti.mongeAmpereMeasure_ite_apply`).

For a convex function that is twice differentiable on `D`, the Aleksandrov measure is the
classical one, `MA_f = det (D²f) dx` on `D` (`TauCeti.mongeAmpereMeasure_eq_withDensity_det`).
On `D` the subdifferential is the gradient, so `MA_f(s) = μ(∇f(s ∩ D))`. The change of variables
formula computes this on the set where the Hessian is nondegenerate, since the gradient is
injective there (`TauCeti.apply_sub_eq_zero_of_gradient_eq`). The gradient image of the set
where the Hessian is degenerate is null, and the Hessian of a convex function has nonnegative
determinant (`TauCeti.isPositive_of_hasFDerivAt_gradient`).

The *Aleksandrov maximum principle* bounds a convex function by its Monge–Ampère mass: if `u` is
convex on a bounded open convex `Ω`, continuous on the closure and nonnegative on the frontier,
then `max (-u x₀) 0 ^ n ≤ C diam(Ω) ^ (n - 1) dist(x₀, ∂Ω) MA_u(Ω)` for `x₀ ∈ Ω`, with
`C = 2 ^ (n + 1) / μ (ball 0 1)`
(`TauCeti.ofReal_neg_pow_mul_addHaar_ball_le_mul_mongeAmpereMeasure`). Every slope `p` of an
affine function through `(x₀, u x₀)` lying below `u` on the frontier is a subgradient of `u` at
some point of `Ω` (`TauCeti.exists_forall_add_inner_le_of_forall_frontier`). When `u ≥ 0` on the
frontier and `u x₀ < 0`, these slopes include a convex set containing a ball of radius
`-u x₀ / diam Ω` and a point of norm `-u x₀ / dist(x₀, ∂Ω)`, and the volume of such a set is
bounded below by `Convex.ofReal_dist_mul_pow_mul_addHaar_ball_le`.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.mongeAmpereMeasure μ f` — the Aleksandrov Monge–Ampère measure of `f`; it is `0` when
  `f` is not convex or `μ` is not absolutely continuous with respect to a Haar measure.

## Main statements

* `TauCeti.measure_setOf_exists_ne_mem_subdifferential_eq_zero` and
  `TauCeti.aedisjoint_subgradientImage` — almost no point is a subgradient at two distinct points,
  so subgradient images of disjoint sets are almost disjoint;
* `TauCeti.mongeAmpereMeasure_apply` — `MA_f(s) = μ(∂f(s ∩ D))` for measurable `s`;
* `TauCeti.mongeAmpereMeasure_compl_interior` — `MA_f` is concentrated on `D`;
* `TauCeti.mongeAmpereMeasure_lt_top` and `TauCeti.isLocallyFiniteMeasure_comap_mongeAmpereMeasure`
  — when `μ` is finite on compact sets, `MA_f` is finite on compact subsets of `D`, so it is a
  locally finite measure on `D`;
* `TauCeti.mongeAmpereMeasure_ite_apply` — the formula for a finite convex function on an open
  set;
* `TauCeti.mongeAmpereMeasure_eq_withDensity_det` and
  `TauCeti.mongeAmpereMeasure_ite_eq_withDensity_det` — for a twice differentiable convex function,
  the Aleksandrov measure is `det (D²f) dx` on the interior of the effective domain;
* `TauCeti.ofReal_neg_pow_mul_addHaar_ball_le_mul_mongeAmpereMeasure` — **the Aleksandrov
  maximum principle**.

/-- **The Aleksandrov maximum principle.** Let `Ω` be a bounded open convex subset of a real inner
product space `E` of finite dimension `n ≥ 1`, and let `u` be convex on `Ω`, continuous on its
closure, and nonnegative on its frontier. Then at every `x₀ ∈ Ω`,

  `max (-u x₀) 0 ^ n * μ (ball 0 1) ≤ 2 ^ (n + 1) * diam Ω ^ (n - 1) * dist(x₀, ∂Ω) * MA_u(Ω)`,

where `dist(x₀, ∂Ω)` is the distance from `x₀` to the complement of `Ω` and `MA_u` is the
Aleksandrov Monge–Ampère measure of `u` (extended by `⊤` off `Ω`) with respect to the additive
Haar measure `μ`. When `MA_u(Ω)` is finite, this bounds the negative part `max (-u x₀) 0` above
on `Ω` and shows that `max (-u x₀) 0 = O(dist(x₀, ∂Ω) ^ (1 / n))` as `x₀` approaches the
boundary. -/
