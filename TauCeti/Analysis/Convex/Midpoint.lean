# Continuous midpoint-convex functions are convex

A function `f` is *midpoint convex* on a set `s` when `f (midpoint ℝ x y) ≤ (f x + f y) / 2` for
all `x, y ∈ s`. Jensen's theorem says that on a convex set a continuous midpoint-convex function is
convex. This is how convexity is usually checked when only a two-point inequality at midpoints is
available, as in the Bruhat--Tits form of nonpositive curvature in metric geometry.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.le_chord_of_midpoint` — on `[0, 1]`, a continuous midpoint-convex real function lies
  below the chord joining its values at `0` and `1`.
* `TauCeti.convexOn_of_midpoint` — on a convex subset of a real topological vector space, a
  continuous midpoint-convex function is convex.
