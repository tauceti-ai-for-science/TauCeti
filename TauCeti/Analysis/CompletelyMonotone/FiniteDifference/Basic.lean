# Complete monotonicity in the finite-difference sense

`TauCeti.IsCompletelyMonotone` asks for a smooth function whose iterated *derivatives* alternate
in sign. There is a second, purely order-theoretic notion, which mentions no derivatives at all:
a function `f : ℝ → ℝ` is completely monotone in the **finite-difference** sense when every
iterated forward difference taken with an arbitrary list `[h₁, …, hₙ]` of nonnegative steps has
the sign `(-1)ⁿ`,
`0 ≤ (-1)ⁿ (Δ_{h₁} ⋯ Δ_{hₙ} f)(t)` for `t ≥ 0`,
where `Δ_h g = fun t => g (t + h) - g t` is Mathlib's `fwdDiff`. Low orders read as `f ≥ 0`,
`f` nonincreasing, `f` "convex along every pair of steps", and so on.

This file introduces the predicate `TauCeti.IsDifferenceCompletelyMonotone` and proves that on
smooth functions it is *exactly* complete monotonicity
(`TauCeti.isCompletelyMonotone_iff_isDifferenceCompletelyMonotone`). The two halves are genuinely
different in character:

* difference to derivative: fixing a list `l`, the sign hypothesis for `k :: l` says that the
  slope of `Δ_l f` over `[t, t + k]` has the sign `(-1)^(|l|+1)`; letting `k → 0⁺` turns that into
  the sign of `(Δ_l f)' = Δ_l f'`, so `-f'` again satisfies the hypothesis and an induction on the
  order finishes the argument;
* derivative to difference: if `f` is completely monotone and `a ≥ 0` then so is
  `t ↦ f t - f (t + a)`, because the `n`-th alternating derivative of `f` is itself completely
  monotone, hence nonincreasing (`TauCeti.IsCompletelyMonotone.sub_comp_add_const`). Iterating
  this over the list gives the sign of every mixed difference.

The finite-difference form is the hypothesis that arises in practice: the alternating differences
of a positive-definite function on the involutive semigroup `[0, ∞) × V` are positive definite,
so the mass of the associated spatial Bochner measure is a function of time all of whose mixed
differences alternate, with no smoothness available a priori. Combining the characterization here
with the mollification of
`TauCeti.Analysis.CompletelyMonotone.FiniteDifference.Mollify` converts that hypothesis into the
input of the Hausdorff--Bernstein--Widder theorem, up to an arbitrarily small shift of the
argument.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.fwdDiffList`: the forward difference `Δ_{h₁} ⋯ Δ_{hₙ} f` along a list of steps.
* `TauCeti.fwdDiffList_congr`: on `[0, ∞)` a mixed difference with nonnegative steps only sees the
  values of the function there, and `TauCeti.fwdDiffList_congr_of_add_mem` sharpens this to any
  set of arguments closed under adding the steps.
* `TauCeti.IsDifferenceCompletelyMonotone`: complete monotonicity in the finite-difference sense.
* `TauCeti.isDifferenceCompletelyMonotone_of_tendsto`: the predicate is closed under pointwise
  limits on `[0, ∞)`, unlike its derivative form.
* `TauCeti.IsDifferenceCompletelyMonotone.neg_derivWithin`: the negated derivative within the
  half-line of a differentiable finite-difference completely monotone function is again one.
* `TauCeti.IsDifferenceCompletelyMonotone.isCompletelyMonotone`: a `C^∞` function that is
  completely monotone in the finite-difference sense is completely monotone.
* `TauCeti.IsCompletelyMonotone.sub_comp_add_const`: if `f` is completely monotone and `0 ≤ a`
  then so is `t ↦ f t - f (t + a)`.
* `TauCeti.isCompletelyMonotone_iff_isDifferenceCompletelyMonotone`: the two notions agree on
  `C^∞` functions.

/-! ## The finite-difference predicate -/

/-- A function `f : ℝ → ℝ` is **completely monotone in the finite-difference sense** if every
mixed forward difference along a list of nonnegative steps has the alternating sign of its
length, at every point of `[0, ∞)`:
`0 ≤ (-1)ⁿ (Δ_{h₁} ⋯ Δ_{hₙ} f)(t)` for `h₁, …, hₙ ≥ 0` and `t ≥ 0`.

Unlike `TauCeti.IsCompletelyMonotone` this mentions no derivative, so it makes sense for an
arbitrary function; on `C^∞` functions the two agree
(`TauCeti.isCompletelyMonotone_iff_isDifferenceCompletelyMonotone`). Mixed steps, rather than the
iterates of a single step, are what makes the notion stable under differentiation. -/
