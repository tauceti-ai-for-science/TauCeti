# Growth bounds for strongly continuous semigroups

This file contains exponential growth bounds for C₀-semigroups, including the
contraction case and the existence of a finite exponential type.

The uniform operator bound this provides also yields strong continuity of `(u, x) ↦ S u x` in
both arguments at once (`StronglyContinuousSemigroup.tendsto_realOperator_apply` and its
`ContinuousOn` form `StronglyContinuousSemigroup.continuousOn_realOperator_apply`), which does
not follow from continuity of `u ↦ S u` alone.

/-- **Joint strong continuity**: if `f i → r` through nonnegative values and `g i → z`, then
`S (f i) (g i) → S r z`.

A C₀-semigroup is strongly, not uniformly, continuous, so this does not follow from continuity
of `u ↦ S.realOperator u` alone; the proof combines strong continuity at `r` with the uniform
operator bound supplied by a growth bound. -/
