# Power-multiplicative norms on completions

The norm of the completion of a seminormed ring extends the norm of the ring by continuity, so
identities between continuous functions of the norm pass from the ring to its completion. This
file records that power-multiplicativity, `‖x ^ n‖ = ‖x‖ ^ n`, is such an identity. A
power-multiplicative norm determines the power-bounded elements of a normed ring with a
topologically nilpotent unit: they are exactly the elements of norm at most one.

## Main results

* `IsPowMul.completion`: the norm of the completion of a seminormed ring with a
  power-multiplicative norm is power-multiplicative.
