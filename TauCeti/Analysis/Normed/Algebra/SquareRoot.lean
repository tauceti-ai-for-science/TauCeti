# Square roots near the identity in a Banach algebra

Squaring, `a ↦ a * a`, has derivative `x ↦ 2 * x` at the identity of a Banach algebra over `ℝ`,
and that derivative is invertible.  The inverse function theorem therefore produces a smooth
partial inverse near `1`: every element close enough to `1` has a square root close to `1`, the
square root depends smoothly on the element, and it is the *only* square root near `1`, because
squaring is injective there.

This file packages that partial inverse as `TauCeti.sqrtNearOne` together with the three facts
downstream arguments need: it fixes `1`, it is smooth at `1`, and it is a two-sided inverse of
squaring on a neighbourhood of `1`.  The two-sided statements are phrased as `Filter.Eventually`
assertions rather than by exhibiting a neighbourhood, since that is how they get used.

The motivating application is the Morse lemma, in
`TauCeti.Analysis.Calculus.Morse.NormalForm`: the operator `(D²f x)⁻¹ ∘ B v` comparing the
averaged Hessian along a segment with the Hessian at a nondegenerate critical point is close to
the identity, and the change of coordinates flattening `f` is built from its square root.  Nothing
here is a substitute for the continuous functional calculus: `CFC.sqrt` computes the *positive*
square root of a positive element of a C⋆-algebra, whereas what is needed here is a square root
near `1` in a bare Banach algebra, with smooth dependence on the element.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.sqrtNearOne`: the local inverse of squaring at the identity.
* `TauCeti.sqrtNearOne_one`, `TauCeti.contDiffAt_sqrtNearOne`: it fixes `1` and is smooth there.
* `TauCeti.eventually_mul_self_sqrtNearOne`: near `1` it is a right inverse of squaring, so its
  value really is a square root.
* `TauCeti.eventually_sqrtNearOne_mul_self`: near `1` it is a left inverse of squaring, which is
  the uniqueness statement: an element close to `1` is recovered from its square.
* `TauCeti.eventually_sqrtNearOne_fixed`: a continuous map fixing `1` and reversing products
  fixes the square root of every fixed element sufficiently close to `1`.

## References

The construction is the inverse function theorem in Banach spaces, as in
S. Lang, *Real and Functional Analysis*, Chapter XIV.
