# A bounded set is exactly as wide as its frontier

In a real normed space a bounded set `V` and its frontier have the same diameter:
`TauCeti.diam_frontier`. One inequality is trivial, `frontier V` being contained in `closure V`.
The other says that the frontier already realises every distance realised inside `V`, and it is
the geometric content: a set cannot be wide and have a narrow boundary.

The mechanism is that a ray leaving a bounded set has to cross the frontier, and crossing it only
*later* than it passes through a given point of the set. Precisely
(`TauCeti.exists_mem_frontier_dist_le`), for `x ∈ V` and any base point `y ≠ x` the ray
`t ↦ y + t • (x - y)`, followed from `t = 1` outwards, eventually leaves the bounded set `V`, and
the segment it traces is connected, so `IsPreconnected.inter_frontier_nonempty` produces a
frontier point `p = y + t • (x - y)` with `t ≥ 1`, whence `dist y p = t * dist y x ≥ dist y x`.

Applying this twice turns a pair of points of `V` into a pair of frontier points at least as far
apart: first push `x` away from `y` to a frontier point `p`, then push `y` away from `p` to a
frontier point `q`, and `dist x y ≤ dist y p ≤ dist p q`. Boundedness is essential and not merely
a convenience of `Metric.diam`, which vanishes on unbounded sets: in `ℝ` the unbounded set
`Metric.ball 0 1 ∪ Set.Ici 2` has frontier `{-1, 1, 2}` of diameter `3`.

Nothing here needs `V` to be open, connected, or measurable, and the ambient space is an arbitrary
real normed space: only the segment and the norm are used.

The intended consumer is layer **L5** of `TauCetiRoadmap/ConformalMapping/README.md`, Carathéodory's
boundary correspondence. There the piece of a domain that a crosscut cuts off has to be shown small,
and what is small is its boundary — the crosscut itself together with the arc of the domain boundary
it separates; `TauCeti.diam_frontier` is what converts that into a bound on the piece.
`TauCeti/Analysis/Complex/Conformal/CutDiameter.lean` carries out that conversion.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.exists_mem_frontier_dist_le` — from a point of a bounded set, the ray away from any other
  base point reaches the frontier no sooner than it reaches that point.
* `TauCeti.diam_le_diam_frontier` and `TauCeti.diam_frontier` — a bounded set is exactly as wide as
  its frontier.
* `TauCeti.diam_le_diam_of_frontier_subset` — hence a bounded set is no wider than any bounded set
  containing its frontier, which is the form a boundary estimate is spent in.

/-- **A ray leaving a bounded set crosses its frontier, and does so no sooner than it passes
through a given point of the set.** For `x` in a bounded set `V` and any base point `y ≠ x`, the
ray from `y` through `x` meets `frontier V` at a point `p` with `dist y x ≤ dist y p`.

The ray is followed from `x` outwards. It leaves `V` because `V` is bounded, the segment traced is
connected, and `IsPreconnected.inter_frontier_nonempty` therefore hands back a frontier
point on it; being beyond `x` on the ray, that point is at least as far from `y` as `x` is. -/

/-- **A bounded set is no wider than its frontier.** Every distance realised between two points of
a bounded set `V` is already realised between two points of `frontier V`: push the first point away
from the second to the frontier, then the second away from the resulting frontier point. -/

/-- **The diameter of a bounded set is the diameter of its frontier.** The frontier is contained in
the closure, which gives one inequality, and `TauCeti.diam_le_diam_frontier` gives the other.

Boundedness cannot be dropped: `Metric.diam` is `0` on an unbounded set, while the frontier of
`Metric.ball 0 1 ∪ Set.Ici 2` in `ℝ` is `{-1, 1, 2}`. -/

  calc diam (frontier V) ≤ diam (closure V) := diam_mono frontier_subset_closure hV.closure

/-- **A bounded set is no wider than anything bounded that contains its frontier.** Enclosing
`frontier V` in a bounded set `W` bounds `diam V` by `diam W`, since by `TauCeti.diam_frontier` the
set and its frontier have the same diameter.

This is the form in which a boundary estimate is spent: what a geometric argument produces is a
*cover* of the boundary of a piece — for a crosscut, the image of the cut together with the arc of
the domain boundary it separates — and what is wanted is the width of the piece itself.
Boundedness of `W` is what `Metric.diam_mono` needs and is not automatic from that of `V`, `W`
being unconstrained apart from the inclusion. -/
