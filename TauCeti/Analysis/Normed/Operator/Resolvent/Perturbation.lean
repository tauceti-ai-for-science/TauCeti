# Bounded perturbations of a resolvent point

Adding a bounded operator `B` to an unbounded operator `A` does not change the domain, so the
perturbed operator is Mathlib's `B +ᵥ A`. On `D(A)` the two operators are related by the
factorisation

`lambda • I - (B + A) = (I - B R(lambda, A)) (lambda • I - A)`,

whose first factor is invertible by the geometric series as soon as `‖B‖ ‖R(lambda, A)‖ < 1`.
This file turns that observation into the three facts a perturbation theorem needs: the resolvent
point survives, the perturbed resolvent is `R(lambda, A) (I - B R(lambda, A))⁻¹`, and it obeys
the bound `r / (1 - ‖B‖ r)`.

All the statements take an upper bound `r` for `‖R(lambda, A)‖` rather than that norm itself,
because that is the form in which callers have their information: a semigroup growth bound
`(omega, M)` supplies `r = M / (lambda - omega)`, and the conclusion then reads
`M / (lambda - omega - M ‖B‖)`.

## Main results

* `ContinuousLinearMap.isResolventAt_vadd`: the perturbed inverse, as an `IsResolventAt` witness.
* `ContinuousLinearMap.mem_resolventSet_vadd`: a resolvent point survives a bounded perturbation
  small against the resolvent.
* `ContinuousLinearMap.resolvent_vadd`: the perturbed resolvent in closed form.
* `ContinuousLinearMap.norm_resolvent_vadd_le`: the norm bound for the perturbed resolvent.
