# Separating two directions by a functional

Two vectors `d₁` and `d₂` of a real locally convex Hausdorff space with `0 ∉ [-d₁, d₂]`, that is,
both nonzero and not on a common ray from `0`, are separated by a continuous functional `ℓ` with
`ℓ d₁ < 0 < ℓ d₂`. This is the geometric Hahn--Banach theorem
`geometric_hahn_banach_point_closed` applied to the point `0` and the segment `[-d₁, d₂]`. Both
strict inequalities are open conditions, so `ℓ` can moreover be perturbed to be nonzero at any
prescribed vector on which some functional does not vanish.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.exists_strongDual_neg_pos_ne_zero`: a functional negative on `d₁`, positive on `d₂`,
  and nonzero at a prescribed vector `u`.
