# The Hermite functions as a Hilbert basis of `L²(ℝ)`

This file instantiates the weighted-measure machinery at the Gaussian weight `w(x) = e^{-x²}` and
the dilated Hermite polynomials `Hₙ(x√2)`, whose `√w`-envelope is exactly the Hermite function
`ψₙ` of `TauCeti.hermiteFunction`.

## Main statements

* `TauCeti.degree_hermiteDilated` — `Hₙ(x√2)` has degree exactly `n`.
* `TauCeti.integral_hermiteDilated_mul_hermiteDilated_mul_gaussianWeight` — the orthogonality
  relation with normalization `cₙ = n!√π`, obtained from the Hermite function orthonormality
  (milestone A2).
* `TauCeti.hermiteHilbertBasis` — **milestone A3**: the Hermite functions as a `HilbertBasis` of
  `L²(ℝ)`, the principal result of this file.
* `TauCeti.coe_hermiteHilbertBasis` — its normal form: the `n`-th basis vector really is `ψₙ`.

/-- The dilation preserves degrees: `Hₙ(√2 · X)` has degree exactly `n`.

`TauCeti.hermiteDilated` itself lives in the `MemLp` layer, where the membership results are
already stated about it; only this degree fact is new here, and only the basis construction
needs it. -/
