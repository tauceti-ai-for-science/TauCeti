# The chord and the arc on a circle

Mathlib's `Circle` carries both a metric, from the inclusion into `ℂ`, and an arc-length API:
`Circle.exp` parametrizes it by angles and `Circle.angleDiff x y` is the length of the arc running
counterclockwise from `x` to `y`. This file relates the two, comparing the *chord* `dist x y` with
the *arc* separating `x` from `y` in both directions, and transports the chord formula along the
translation and real scaling that carry `Circle.exp` to Mathlib's `circleMap ζ ρ`. It also records
the chord with one endpoint allowed *off* the circle — the distance from a point of `circleMap ζ ρ`
to an arbitrary point of the plane, which is the law of cosines — and reads off from that law when
such a point lies in a disc `ball c r`, whose centre `c` is unrelated to the centre `ζ` of the
circle.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.exp_mul_I_sub_exp_mul_I` — the polar form of the chord: the half-angle sine rotated a
  quarter turn past the midpoint direction.
* `TauCeti.dist_circleExp_eq_two_mul_abs_sin` — the chord subtended by an arc of angle `θ` of the
  unit circle has length `2 * |sin (θ / 2)|`.
* `TauCeti.dist_circleMap_eq_two_mul_abs_sin` — its form for the circle `circleMap ζ ρ` of arbitrary
  centre and radius, where the chord between the angles `θ` and `θ'` has length
  `2 * |ρ| * |sin ((θ - θ') / 2)|`, and
  `TauCeti.dist_circleMap_eq_two_mul_sin_abs`, the same formula with the sign of the angular
  difference cleared, valid for angles at most a full turn apart.
* `TauCeti.dist_circleMap_le_dist_circleMap_of_abs_sub_le` — within half a turn that chord grows
  with the angular gap, so the distance to a fixed point of the circle is unimodal along it, and
  `TauCeti.ordConnected_inter_setOf_dist_circleMap_lt` — consequently a ball meets an arc of
  angular width at most `π` in a set of angles that is order connected.
* `TauCeti.exists_mem_Ioo_circleMap_eq_and_abs_sub_lt_of_mem_ball_circleMap_image_Ioo` — the
  inverse comparison on an arc that does not wrap: a point of the arc close enough to a fixed
  point of it is the image of a
  nearby angle, so closeness in the plane is closeness in angle.
* `TauCeti.dist_circleMap_sq` — the law of cosines: the point of `circleMap ζ ρ` at angle `θ` is at
  distance `ρ ^ 2 + dist ζ c ^ 2 - 2 * ρ * dist ζ c * cos (θ - arg (c - ζ))`, squared, from an
  arbitrary point `c` of the plane.
* `TauCeti.circleMap_mem_ball_iff_sq` and `TauCeti.circleMap_mem_closedBall_iff_sq` — that law
  compared with `r ^ 2`: when the point at angle `θ` lies in the disc `ball c r`, respectively in
  `closedBall c r`.
* `TauCeti.circleMap_mem_ball_of_mem_Icc` — since the criterion sees the angle only through
  `cos (θ - arg (c - ζ))`, the angles it admits form an arc: it holds throughout an interval of
  angles inside a period centred at `arg (c - ζ)` as soon as it holds at both ends.
* `TauCeti.lipschitzWith_one_circleExp` and `TauCeti.diam_circleExp_image_Icc_le` — the chord is at
  most the arc, so an arc of angles of length `b - a` has image of diameter at most `b - a`, and
  `TauCeti.diam_range_circlePath_le` — the same bound for Mathlib's arc `Circle.path x y`, whose
  angle is `Circle.angleDiff x y`.
* `TauCeti.min_angleDiff_le_pi_div_two_mul_dist` — the shorter of the two arcs joining two points of
  the circle has length at most `π / 2` times their distance.

## The argument

The first two are Mathlib's estimates for the normalized chord `‖exp (I * θ) - 1‖`, read off the
factorization `exp a - exp b = (exp (a - b) - 1) * exp b`: the chord formula is
`Complex.norm_exp_I_mul_ofReal_sub_one` and the Lipschitz bound is
`Real.norm_exp_I_mul_ofReal_sub_one_le`, so neither is derived from the other. The converse
comparison `TauCeti.min_angleDiff_le_pi_div_two_mul_dist` is Jordan's inequality `Real.mul_le_sin`
applied to the chord formula; it is the direction that turns a hypothesis about the ambient metric
into a bound on an arc, and so the one a transport argument such as
`TauCeti/Topology/JordanCurve/SmallArc.lean` consumes.

/-- **The chord with the sign of the angular difference cleared.** For angles at most a full turn
apart the chord `TauCeti.dist_circleMap_eq_two_mul_abs_sin` is `2 * |ρ| * sin (|θ - θ'| / 2)`: the
absolute value moves from outside the sine to inside it.

The width restriction is what makes the two forms differ: it puts the half-angle in `[0, π]`, where
the sine is nonnegative, and past a full turn the half-angle leaves that interval and `|sin|` and
`sin ∘ |·|` part company. Up to `π` the right-hand side is moreover an increasing function of the
angular gap, the half-angle then staying in `[0, π / 2]`; beyond `π` the formula still holds but the
chord shrinks again as the gap widens. -/

/-- **Within half a turn, the chord grows with the angular gap.** If the angle `u` is no further
from `θ₀` than `v` is, and `v` is within half a turn of `θ₀`, then the point of `circleMap ζ ρ` at
angle `u` is no further from the one at `θ₀` than the point at `v` is.

Both chords are `TauCeti.dist_circleMap_eq_two_mul_sin_abs`, and the half-angles they feed to the
sine stay in `[0, π / 2]`, where the sine is monotone. The restriction to half a turn is sharp:
antipodal points are the furthest apart, and beyond them the chord shrinks again. -/

number: the half-angle stays in `[0, π]`, where the sine rises to `π / 2` and falls back, so it is
bounded below by its value at whichever end of `[m / 2, w / 2]` the half-angle has not passed.

If `w ≤ π` the first of the two is the binding one and the second is slack; both are needed exactly
because an arc of angular width beyond `π` is allowed. -/

`[θ₀ - π, θ₀ + π]`, the angles of `s` whose points lie within `δ` of the point at angle `θ₀` form an
order-connected subset of `s`.

The chord distance to `θ₀` falls and then rises as the angle sweeps across `s`
(`TauCeti.dist_circleMap_le_dist_circleMap_of_abs_sub_le`), so an angle between two admitted ones is
itself no further from `θ₀` than the admitted one on its side of `θ₀`. The angle `θ₀` need not lie
in `s`, and the radius `δ` is arbitrary: for large `δ` the trace is all of `s`. -/

/-- **The law of cosines for a point of a circle.** The point of `circleMap ζ ρ` at angle `θ` is at
distance `ρ ^ 2 + dist ζ c ^ 2 - 2 * ρ * dist ζ c * cos (θ - arg (c - ζ))`, squared, from an
arbitrary point `c`. For `ρ ≥ 0` this is the law of cosines as usually read: in the triangle with
vertices `ζ`, `circleMap ζ ρ θ` and `c`, the angle at `ζ` between the two sides of lengths `ρ` and
`dist ζ c` is `θ - arg (c - ζ)`. It is the chord formula
`TauCeti.dist_circleMap_eq_two_mul_abs_sin` with one endpoint allowed off the circle.

Nothing is assumed, and the identity is the signed-radius extension of that reading. For `ρ < 0`
the point `circleMap ζ ρ θ` is the one at angle `θ + π` on the circle of radius `-ρ`, so the side
at `ζ` has length `-ρ` and points in the direction `θ + π`; the identity still holds as stated
because only `ρ ^ 2` and `ρ * cos` occur, and the two sign changes cancel. For `c = ζ` both terms
carrying `dist ζ c` vanish, so the junk value `arg 0 = 0` does no harm and the identity reads
`dist (circleMap ζ ρ θ) ζ ^ 2 = ρ ^ 2`. -/

/-- **When a point of a circle lies in a disc**, read off the law of cosines. For `r ≥ 0` and a

`circleMap ζ ρ θ` lies in `ball c r` exactly when
`ρ ^ 2 + dist ζ c ^ 2 - r ^ 2 < 2 * ρ * dist ζ c * cos (θ - arg (c - ζ))`.

This is `TauCeti.dist_circleMap_sq` compared with `r ^ 2`, both sides of `dist … < r` being

`sphere ζ ρ` at angle `θ`, and for `ρ < 0` it is the point of `sphere ζ (-ρ)` at angle `θ + π`,
the criterion following it as the law of cosines does. Since the right-hand side depends on `θ`
only through `cos (θ - arg (c - ζ))`, the angles it admits form an arc
(`TauCeti.circleMap_mem_ball_of_mem_Icc`).

At a point `ζ` of the boundary circle `sphere c r` the two squared radii cancel and, for `ρ > 0`,
the surviving condition `ρ ^ 2 < 2 * ρ * r * cos (θ - arg (c - ζ))` may be divided by `ρ`; that

/-- **A circle meets a disc in a connected set of angles.** If the angles `a` and `b` both lie
within `π` of the direction `arg (c - ζ)` from the centre `ζ` of the circle to the centre `c` of
the disc, and both put the point of `sphere ζ ρ` they name inside `ball c r`, then so does every
angle in `[a, b]`.

This is `TauCeti.circleMap_mem_ball_iff_sq` read through the unimodality of `cos` on a period
centred at `arg (c - ζ)`, which is `Real.lt_cos_of_mem_Icc`. Neither `0 < r` nor any relation
between `ζ` and the disc is assumed: the first is forced by the hypotheses, and the second is not
needed, so the conclusion covers a cutting circle centred anywhere and not only the circular
crosscut at a boundary point `ζ` of the disc. Two
degenerate cases are covered as well, in both of which the criterion is independent of the angle: a
circle centred at `c` itself, whose points are all at the same distance from `c`, and the circle of
radius `ρ = 0`, which is the single point `ζ`. -/

/-- **A closed arc is no wider than its angle.** Mathlib's arc `Circle.path x y`, which runs
counterclockwise from `x` to `y`, has range of diameter at most the length `Circle.angleDiff x y`
of that arc.

This is `TauCeti.diam_circleExp_image_Icc_le` read through `Circle.range_path`, which presents the
closed arc as the `Circle.exp` image of an interval of angles of length `Circle.angleDiff x y`. It
is stated for the range rather than for the path so that it applies unchanged to the reversed arc,
whose range is the same by `Path.symm_range`. -/

/-- **The shorter arc is controlled by the chord**: of the two arcs joining `x` to `y` on the

This is the direction of the comparison that converts a hypothesis about the ambient metric into a
bound on an arc, and so the one a transport argument consumes. -/
