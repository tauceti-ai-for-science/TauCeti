# Point-set topology of path components

Paths and path homotopies based in `pathComponent x₀` remain in that component, without any
local path-connectedness assumption. This gives path connectedness of the component as a
subspace; under local path connectedness of the ambient space, openness of path components also
gives local path connectedness of the subspace.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.homotopic_pathComponent_of_map_subtypeVal_homotopic`: path homotopies reflect along
  the inclusion of a path component.
* Instances making `↥(pathComponent x₀)` path connected and locally path connected.
* `TauCeti.pathComponentSelf`: a point viewed in its own path component.
* `Joined.eq_of_totallyDisconnectedSpace` and
  `ZerothHomotopy.mk_injective_of_totallyDisconnectedSpace`: in a totally disconnected space,
  the path components are the points.
* `TauCeti.PathComponentBasepoints`: a choice of a basepoint in each path component, with
  `TauCeti.PathComponentBasepoints.choose` giving one.
