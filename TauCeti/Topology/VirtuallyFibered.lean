# Virtually fibered spaces

A space `M` is *virtually fibered* when it has a connected finite-sheeted covering space that
fibers over the circle, in the sense of `TauCeti.FibersOverCircle`. This is the conclusion of
Thurston's virtual fibering question for hyperbolic 3-manifolds (Kirby's problem 3.51), answered
by Agol: every closed hyperbolic 3-manifold has a finite cover that is a surface bundle over the
circle.

The covering space is required to be connected, as is customary, and the covering map to be a
finite cover in the sense of `TauCeti.IsFiniteCover`: surjective with finite fibres. Surjectivity
is imposed because Mathlib's `IsCoveringMap` allows empty fibres: without it a space would be
virtually fibered as soon as one of its components is. With both conditions a virtually fibered
space is connected (`TauCeti.IsVirtuallyFibered.connectedSpace`).

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.IsVirtuallyFibered M`: some connected space is a finite cover of `M` and fibers over
  the circle; `TauCeti.isVirtuallyFibered_iff` unfolds it.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.FibersOverCircle.isVirtuallyFibered`: a connected space that fibers over the circle is
  virtually fibered, through the identity cover.
* `Homeomorph.isVirtuallyFibered_iff`: being virtually fibered is invariant under homeomorphisms.
* `TauCeti.IsVirtuallyFibered.connectedSpace`, `TauCeti.IsVirtuallyFibered.infinite`: a virtually
  fibered space is connected and infinite; in particular a finite space is not virtually fibered.
