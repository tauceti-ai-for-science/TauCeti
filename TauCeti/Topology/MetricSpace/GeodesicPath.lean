# Geodesic segments as points of path space

The path space of a topological space `X` is `C(I, X)`, the continuous maps from the unit interval
with the compact-open topology; when `X` is a pseudometric space, as below, this is the topology of
uniform convergence since the domain is compact.
This file singles out the geodesic segments inside it: `TauCeti.geodesicPaths X` is the set of
paths `γ` with `dist (γ s) (γ t) = |s - t| * dist (γ 0) (γ 1)`. These are exactly the restrictions
to `[0, 1]` of the curves `TauCeti.IsGeodesicSegment` describes, so a pseudometric space is a
geodesic space exactly when every pair of points is the pair of endpoints of a geodesic path.

The defining identity only involves finitely many evaluations at a time, so the set of geodesic
paths is closed in path space, and on a metric space so is the relation between a pair of points
and a geodesic path joining them. On a Polish space this relation is therefore a closed subset of
a Polish space; this is the input that a measurable selection theorem needs to choose a geodesic
measurably in its endpoints, which is how a law of pairs of points is lifted to a law of geodesics
in optimal transport.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.geodesicPaths X`: the geodesic segments of `X`, as a subset of `C(I, X)`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.mem_geodesicPaths_iff_isGeodesicSegment`: a path is a geodesic path exactly when its
  extension to `ℝ` is a geodesic segment between its endpoints.
* `TauCeti.exists_mem_geodesicPaths_iff`: two points are the endpoints of a geodesic path exactly
  when they are joined by a geodesic segment; `TauCeti.isGeodesicSpace_iff_exists_mem_geodesicPaths`
  restates the geodesic-space condition this way.
* `TauCeti.isClosed_geodesicPaths`: the geodesic paths form a closed subset of path space.
* `TauCeti.isClosed_setOf_mem_geodesicPaths_endpoints`: on a metric space, the relation between a
  pair of points and the geodesic paths joining them is closed.
