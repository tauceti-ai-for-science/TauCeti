# Separation, countability, and local compactness of glued spaces

A space obtained by gluing open charts is second countable when the chart family is countable
and every chart is second countable. It is locally compact when every chart is locally compact.
It is Hausdorff exactly when the gluing relation between each pair of charts is closed in their
product. The latter criterion isolates the mathematical separation argument needed in applications:
for example, toric charts must prove that their monomial overlap relation is closed.
