# A map of covering spaces with locally connected target is a covering map

Let `p : E → X` and `q : F → X` be covering maps and let `g : E → F` be a continuous map over
`X`, that is, `q ∘ g = p`. This file proves that `g` is itself a covering map as soon as `F` is
locally connected.

The proof is the standard sheet comparison. Around a point `f₀` of `F`, choose a connected open
neighbourhood in `F` whose image `V` lies inside the intersection of evenly covered
neighbourhoods for `p` and `q`, and trivialize both projections over `V`. A sheet of `p` over `V`
is the image of `V` under
`v ↦ tp.symm (v, i)`, so it is connected, and the sheet index of its image under `g` is a
continuous map from `V` to a discrete space, hence constant. So `g` carries each sheet of `p`
over `V` onto a single sheet of `q`, and injectively, because `p = q ∘ g` is injective on it.
The sheet `W` of `q` through `f₀` is therefore evenly covered by `g`, with fibre the set of
sheets of `p` that land in `W`.

Local connectedness of `F` produces the connected neighbourhood whose open, connected image is
`V`. It is used exactly once, to make the sheet index locally constant.

Neither total space is assumed connected and `g` is not assumed surjective. That is consistent
because `IsCoveringMap` allows empty fibres: over a sheet of `q` missed by `g` the fibre of `g`
is empty.

/-- The evenly covered neighbourhood of `f₀` for a map `g` over `X` between two trivialized
projections, cut out by a connected open set `V` of the base lying inside both base sets.

The neighbourhood is the sheet of `q` over `V` through `f₀`, and the fibre over it is the set of
sheet indices of `p` that `g` sends into that sheet. -/
