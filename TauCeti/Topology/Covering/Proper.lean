# Proper maps and covering maps

A covering map is proper exactly when its fibres are finite
(`IsCoveringMap.isProperMap_iff_finite_fiber`): over an evenly covered open set `U` the map is
the projection `U × F → U` with `F` the discrete fibre, which is closed when `F` is finite, and
being a closed map is local on the target. Thus the preimage of a compact set under a
finite-sheeted cover is compact; this is what makes a finite cover of a punctured compact surface
compact away from small neighbourhoods of the punctures.

Conversely, a local homeomorphism is a covering map over the part of the base where it is proper.

A local homeomorphism `f : E → X` need not be a covering map: an open inclusion is a local
homeomorphism, and it is not evenly covered at the boundary of its image.  What fails there is
properness, and the classical remedy is that a *proper* local homeomorphism between Hausdorff
spaces is a covering map.  Mathlib records the special case of a compact total space
(`isLocalHomeomorph_iff_isCoveringMap`) and the closed-map form
`IsClosedMap.isCoveringMapOn_of_isLocalHomeomorphOn`.

This file gives the version *over an open subset* `s` of a locally compact base: if every compact
subset of `s` has compact preimage, then `f` is a covering map over `s`, whatever happens outside
`s`.  This is the form a holomorphic map of a domain supplies when it is known to send points
near the boundary of the domain close to a closed set `C`: over the complement `s = Cᶜ` the map
is proper, hence a covering.

## Main results

* `IsCoveringMap.isProperMap`, `IsCoveringMap.isProperMap_iff_finite_fiber`: a covering map is
  proper exactly when its fibres are finite.
* `IsCoveringMapOn.of_isLocalHomeomorph_of_isCompact_preimage` -- a local homeomorphism is a
  covering map over an open set on whose compact subsets it is proper.
