# The balanced product of a quotient covering map with a discrete set

Let a group `G` act on a space `E` so that `q : E → X` presents `X` as the quotient `E / G` in
the strong sense of Mathlib's `IsQuotientCoveringMap`: the fibres of `q` are the orbits, and every
point of `E` has a neighbourhood whose `G`-translates are pairwise disjoint. For a discrete
`G`-set `A`, the *balanced product* `BalancedProduct G E A` is the quotient of `E × A` by the
diagonal action of `G`. Since `q` is invariant along the first factor it descends to

`BalancedProduct.proj A : BalancedProduct G E A → X`,

and the theorem of this file is that this projection is a covering map, with fibre `A`.

Neither space is assumed connected, and no local connectedness of `X` is needed. Over the base
set `q '' U` cut out by a set `U` whose `G`-translates are pairwise disjoint, the sheets of the
projection are the images of `U ×ˢ {a}`, one for each `a : A`, and each defining property of a
sheet comes straight from the disjointness of those translates: two points of `U` with the same
class differ by a group element carrying `U` into itself, hence by the identity.

The intended reading is the cover of `X` attached to a set acted on by the deck group of a
regular cover. For `E` the universal cover of `X` and `G` its fundamental group, this is the
covering space attached to an arbitrary `π₁(X, x₀)`-set; no transitivity, and hence no
connectedness of the resulting cover, is assumed. The transitive case `A = G ⧸ H`, where the
balanced product is `E / H`, is `IsQuotientCoveringMap.isCoveringMap_of_comp`, proved
there for an abstract presentation of `E / H` rather than for a fixed model.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.BalancedProduct`: the quotient of `E × A` by the diagonal action of `G`.
* `TauCeti.isQuotientCoveringMap_quotientMk_of_smul_disjoint`: an action with locally pairwise
  disjoint translates presents its orbit space as a quotient covering map.
* `TauCeti.BalancedProduct.isQuotientCoveringMap_mk`: the class map `E × A → E ×_G A` is one such.
* `TauCeti.BalancedProduct.isCoveringMap_proj`: **the balanced product of a quotient covering map
  with a discrete set is a covering map.**
* `TauCeti.BalancedProduct.fiberEquiv`: its fibre over `q e` is `A`, through `a ↦ ⟦(e, a)⟧`. This
  last bijection is purely algebraic: it uses no topology, only that the action on `E` is free and
  that the fibres of `q` are its orbits.

## References

The `IsQuotientCoveringMap` interface used here — the predicate itself, its `disjoint` and
`apply_eq_iff_mem_orbit` fields, `IsQuotientCoveringMap.isOpenQuotientMap`, and
`IsOpen.trivializationDiscrete` — is Junyan Xu's, in `Mathlib/Topology/Covering/Quotient.lean`
and `Mathlib/Topology/Covering/Basic.lean`. The sheet bookkeeping follows the subgroup case in
`TauCeti/Topology/Covering/Quotient.lean`.
