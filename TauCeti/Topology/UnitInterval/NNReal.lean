# The unit interval inside the nonnegative reals

Two facts about `unitInterval.toNNReal : I → ℝ≥0`, the inclusion of the unit interval into the
nonnegative reals: its values are at most one, and clamping a nonnegative real `t` to the unit
interval with `Set.projIcc` and reading it back in `ℝ≥0` gives `min t 1`.  They let paths
parametrized by the unit interval be reparametrized by a nonnegative time, as in
`TauCeti.Topology.PathSpace.Moore.Comparison.Basic`.
