# The cube and its boundary

Mathlib's higher homotopy groups `π_ n X x` are built from generalized loops `Ω^ N X x`,
continuous maps `I^N → X` sending the cube boundary `Cube.boundary N`
(`{y | ∃ i, y i = 0 ∨ y i = 1}`) to the base point. Reasoning about `π_ n` for `n ≥ 2`
needs to know how the cube and, crucially, its *boundary* are connected: the boundary of an
`n`-cube is the topological sphere `S^{n-1}`, which is connected precisely when `n ≥ 2`.
Mathlib records the cube boundary set but proves nothing about its connectivity.

This file supplies that missing input:

* the whole cube `I^N` is path connected (`TauCeti.isPathConnected_cube`);
* its boundary is path connected as soon as the index type has at least two elements
  (`TauCeti.isPathConnected_cubeBoundary`).

It also records how the boundary of a cube with one extra direction splits, mirroring Mathlib's
`Cube.boundary_sum_iff`: a point of `I^(Option N)` is on the boundary exactly when its `none`
coordinate is `0` or `1` or its remaining coordinates are on the boundary of `I^N`
(`Cube.boundary_option_iff`), and likewise for the first coordinate of `I^(Fin (n + 1))`
(`Cube.boundary_fin_succ_iff`). This is how a cube `I × I^N` with a distinguished first direction,
as used for relative homotopy groups, is compared with the absolute cube `I^(Option N)` along
`TauCeti.piOptionEquivProdHomeomorph` (`TauCeti.piOptionEquivProdHomeomorph_symm_mem_boundary`).

The resulting path-connectedness declarations expose `JoinedIn` witnesses through their
`.joinedIn` methods, so callers can use the generic connectedness API directly.

The paths are elementary: a coordinate is dragged to `0` along the straight line
`pathTowardZero`, and any boundary point is joined to the corner `0` in two phases that each
keep one coordinate pinned at an endpoint, so the whole journey stays inside the boundary.
The two-element hypothesis is exactly what lets the second phase pin a *different* coordinate
at `0` while releasing the first.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.pathTowardZero`: the straight-line path in `I` from `a` to `0`.
* `TauCeti.isPathConnected_cube`: `I^N` is path connected.
* `TauCeti.zero_mem_cubeBoundary`: the corner `0` lies on the boundary.
* `TauCeti.isPathConnected_cubeBoundary`: for `[Nontrivial N]`, `Cube.boundary N` is path
  connected.
* `Cube.boundary_option_iff`, `Cube.boundary_fin_succ_iff`: the boundaries of `I^(Option N)`
  and `I^(Fin (n + 1))`.
* `TauCeti.piOptionEquivProdHomeomorph_symm_mem_boundary`: a point of `I × I^N` whose first
  coordinate is `0` or `1`, or whose second lies on the boundary of `I^N`, is sent to the boundary
  of `I^(Option N)`.
