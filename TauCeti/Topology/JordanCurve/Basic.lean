# Jordan curves

A **Jordan curve** — a simple closed curve — is a subset of a topological space homeomorphic to
the circle. This file introduces the predicate `TauCeti.IsJordanCurve` and its basic API.

The circle is Mathlib's `Circle`, the unit circle of `ℂ` as a topological group; the notion itself
is purely topological, so `TauCeti.IsJordanCurve` is stated for a subset of an arbitrary
topological space. `ℂ` is mentioned only by the two concrete curves towards the end of the file:
the model curve, a circle `Metric.sphere c r` of positive radius, and the frontier of a bounded
convex set with nonempty interior. The model is built from the complex affine change of coordinates
`w ↦ (w - c) / r`, so it uses the field structure of `ℂ` and not only its metric, and the convex
frontier is obtained from the model by transport.

Phrasing the predicate as *the set is homeomorphic to the circle*, rather than *the set is the
range of a continuous map on `[0, 1]` that is injective except for matching endpoints*, is what
makes it usable: over a Hausdorff ambient space the two agree, because there a continuous injection
out of a compact space is an embedding, but the parametrized form buries that argument in every
use. Passing from a parametrization to the predicate is `TauCeti.IsJordanCurve.image`, which turns
a continuous injective map defined on a set already known to be a Jordan curve — a circle in `ℂ`,
say — into a proof that its image is one; `TauCeti.IsJordanCurve.of_image` runs the other way,
transporting the property back to a compact set from an image already known to be a Jordan curve.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.IsJordanCurve` — a set homeomorphic to the circle.
* `TauCeti.jordanParam` — the parametrization of a Jordan curve by the circle underlying a
  homeomorphism of the curve with `Circle`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.IsJordanCurve.isCompact`, `TauCeti.IsJordanCurve.isPathConnected`,
  `TauCeti.IsJordanCurve.nonempty` and `TauCeti.IsJordanCurve.not_subsingleton` — a Jordan curve is
  a nonempty compact path-connected set with more than one point.
* `TauCeti.IsJordanCurve.image` and `TauCeti.IsJordanCurve.of_image` — being a Jordan curve
  transfers in both directions along a map that is continuous and injective on the set, provided
  the codomain is Hausdorff (and, in the direction that transports the property back from the
  image, the source set is known to be compact).
* `TauCeti.IsJordanCurve.image_homeomorph` and `TauCeti.isJordanCurve_image_homeomorph_iff` — being
  a Jordan curve is invariant under a homeomorphism of the ambient spaces; no separation axiom is
  needed.
* `TauCeti.continuous_jordanParam`, `TauCeti.jordanParam_injective`,
  `TauCeti.isInducing_jordanParam`, `TauCeti.range_jordanParam`, `TauCeti.jordanParam_apply` and
  `TauCeti.jordanParam_apply_apply` — the parametrization of a Jordan curve by the circle is a
  continuous injection, is inducing, traces out exactly the curve, and undoes `e`; this is what
  carries a statement about the circle to one about an arbitrary Jordan curve.
* `TauCeti.sphereCircleHomeomorph` and `TauCeti.isJordanCurve_sphere` — a circle of positive radius
  in `ℂ` is a Jordan curve, by the affine change of coordinates `w ↦ (w - c) / r`.
* `TauCeti.isJordanCurve_frontier_of_convex` — the frontier of a bounded convex subset of `ℂ` with
  nonempty interior is a Jordan curve. This is `TauCeti.isJordanCurve_sphere` with the disc
  weakened to an arbitrary convex body, the affine change of coordinates being replaced by Mathlib's
  gauge rescaling.
* `TauCeti.locallyConnectedSpace_sphere` and `TauCeti.IsJordanCurve.locallyConnectedSpace` — a
  circle in `ℂ`, and hence every Jordan curve, is locally connected.

## Motivation

This is the vocabulary layer **L5** of the conformal-mapping roadmap
(`TauCetiRoadmap/ConformalMapping/README.md`) is stated in: its milestone, the Carathéodory
boundary correspondence, is about the Riemann map of a *Jordan domain*, and the roadmap records
that the pinned Mathlib has no Jordan-curve vocabulary to state it against. The complex-analytic
half — Jordan domains, the discs among them, and the boundary of a domain that a conformal map
carries onto a disc — is in `TauCeti/Analysis/Complex/Conformal/Jordan/Domain.lean`.

Local connectedness of a Jordan curve is what that milestone needs of the *hypothesis* side: the
route to the extension theorem for a Jordan domain `Ω` runs through Carathéodory's continuity
theorem, whose hypothesis is that `frontier Ω` be locally connected, and
`TauCeti.IsJordanCurve.locallyConnectedSpace` is what discharges it (as
`TauCeti.IsJordanDomain.locallyConnectedSpace_frontier`). Mathlib knows the circle is compact,
connected and path connected, but records no local connectedness for it, and the property is not
preserved by continuous images, so it is proved here from
`TauCeti.locallyConnectedSpace_image_of_isCompact`.

This is the converse of `TauCeti.IsJordanCurve.image`; compactness of the source has to be assumed
here, since it is no longer inherited from the curve. It is the form in which the predicate is
verified when the curve is the *unknown* rather than the parameter: one exhibits a continuous
injective map of the set onto a set already known to be a Jordan curve, as the boundary
correspondence does with the boundary of a disc. -/

/-! ## The parametrization by the circle

Every transport of a statement about `Circle` to a Jordan curve goes through the parametrization
`jordanParam e` attached to a homeomorphism `e`, so its properties — continuity, injectivity,
range, and that it is inducing — are collected here rather than rebuilt at each use, both by the
cutting of a curve at one or two of its points
(`TauCeti/Topology/JordanCurve/Separation.lean`) and by the quantitative form of that cutting
(`TauCeti/Topology/JordanCurve/SmallArc.lean`). -/

rather than a coerced parameter. -/

This is `TauCeti.isJordanCurve_sphere` with the disc weakened to an arbitrary convex body, which it

supplies an *ambient* homeomorphism `e : ℂ ≃ₜ ℂ` carrying `frontier s` onto the unit circle
(`exists_homeomorph_image_interior_closure_frontier_eq_unitBall`), so the affine change of
coordinates above is simply replaced by a nonlinear one and no further topology is needed.

The set is asked neither to be open nor to be nonempty: what a convex set needs in order to have a
one-dimensional frontier is that it be *solid*, and that is `(interior s).Nonempty`. Without it the
statement fails — a segment is convex and bounded, and is its own frontier. -/
