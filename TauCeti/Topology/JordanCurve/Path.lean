# Jordan curves traced by paths

A path whose two endpoints agree is a parametrised closed curve, but its range need not be a
Jordan curve: the path may pause, retrace an arc, or cross itself. This file supplies the exact
criterion needed to exclude those degeneracies. If a closed path has no repeated values except
for its two endpoint parameters, its range is a Jordan curve
(`TauCeti.isJordanCurve_range_of_eq_or_eq_endpoints`).

The proof uses the quotient model of the circle already in Mathlib. The extension of a path
`γ : Path x x` to `ℝ` has equal values at `0` and `1`, so
`AddCircle.liftIco 1 0 γ.extend` factors it through the additive circle `ℝ / ℤ`. The hypothesis on
repetitions says precisely that this factor is injective, and its range is the range of `γ`. The
additive circle is itself a Jordan curve, `AddCircle.homeomorphCircle` identifying it with
`Circle`, so `TauCeti.IsJordanCurve.image` carries that along the factor: the compactness argument
upgrading a continuous injection to a homeomorphism onto its image is already packaged there and is
not repeated here.

The condition is stated directly rather than bundled as a new notion of simple closed path. This
is the only operation needed here, and keeping it as a theorem hypothesis avoids introducing a
second simplicity vocabulary alongside Mathlib's path API.

## Gluing two arcs

The criterion has one immediate use that is worth naming on its own: two *arcs* — ranges of
injective paths — that share their two endpoints and meet nowhere else glue to a Jordan curve
(`TauCeti.isJordanCurve_range_union_range_of_inter_eq_pair`). The closed path traversed is
`γ.trans δ.symm`, whose range is `range γ ∪ range δ`; the meeting hypothesis is what turns a
coincidence between a value of `γ` and a value of `δ` into a coincidence of endpoints, and
injectivity of each of the two paths handles the coincidences internal to one of them. The
endpoints are not asked to be distinct: injectivity of `δ` already forces that, since a path with
equal endpoints repeats the value at the two distinct parameters `0` and `1`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.isJordanCurve_range_of_eq_or_eq_endpoints` — the range of a closed path whose only
  possible repetition is its pair of endpoints is a Jordan curve.
* `TauCeti.isJordanCurve_range_union_range_of_inter_eq_pair` — two arcs with the same two
  endpoints, meeting exactly there, glue to a Jordan curve.

## Roadmap role

This is the topological gluing step used by layer **L5** of
`TauCetiRoadmap/ConformalMapping/README.md`, the Carathéodory boundary correspondence. A
finite-length image crosscut is already packaged as a path with exactly this simplicity property in
`TauCeti/Analysis/Complex/Conformal/Crosscut/Path.lean`; when its two boundary ends coincide, the
first result below identifies the closure of that crosscut as a Jordan curve, and when they are
distinct the second closes that crosscut up with an arc of the boundary of the image domain. The
coincident-end specialization is in `TauCeti/Analysis/Complex/Conformal/Crosscut/Jordan.lean` and
the distinct-end one in `TauCeti/Analysis/Complex/Conformal/Crosscut/Arc.lean`.

/-- **Two arcs meeting exactly at their common endpoints glue to a Jordan curve.** Let
`γ δ : Path x y` be injective and let their ranges meet in exactly the two endpoints,
`range γ ∩ range δ = {x, y}`. Then `range γ ∪ range δ` is a Jordan curve.

The curve traversed is `γ.trans δ.symm`, a closed path at `x` whose range is `range γ ∪ range δ`
by `Path.trans_range` and `Path.symm_range`. Its only repetitions are the ones
`TauCeti.isJordanCurve_range_of_eq_or_eq_endpoints` allows: a coincidence between two parameters on
the same half is excluded by injectivity of that half, and one between the two halves lands in
`{x, y}`, so it is either the pair `{0, 1}` of endpoint parameters or the single parameter `1 / 2`
at which the two halves are joined.

Distinctness of `x` and `y` is a consequence rather than a hypothesis: `δ 0 = δ 1` would contradict
injectivity of `δ`. -/
