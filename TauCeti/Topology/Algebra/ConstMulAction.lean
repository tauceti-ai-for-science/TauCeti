# Transfer instances for restricted and properly discontinuous actions

This file records generic instances for actions on a topological space that typeclass search
cannot otherwise reach, and continuity of maps equal to fixed-element scalar actions.
A submonoid, and hence a subgroup, inherits `ContinuousConstSMul` from
an ambient scalar action; and a properly discontinuous action has `Finite` point stabilisers.
It also records that a properly discontinuous scalar family on a nonempty σ-compact space is
countable, and that the translates of a compact set under it form a locally finite family.
Conversely, for a jointly continuous action of a `T₁` group with separately continuous
multiplication, local finiteness of the translates of any nonempty set forces the group topology
to be discrete. Likewise, a nonempty open set disjoint from all of its nontrivial translates
forces the acting topological group to be discrete, and on such a set the orbit projection is an
open embedding.

## Main results

* `Submonoid.continuousConstSMul` and `TauCeti.Subgroup.continuousConstSMul`: continuity
  in the point is inherited by a submonoid, hence by a subgroup.
* `SubMulAction.properlyDiscontinuousSMul`: proper discontinuity is inherited by every invariant
  subspace.
* `TauCeti.properlyDiscontinuousSMul_of_conjAct_smul_eq`: a conjugate `g H g⁻¹` of a
  properly discontinuous subgroup `H` acts properly discontinuously.
* `TauCeti.finite_stabilizer_of_properlyDiscontinuousSMul`: a properly discontinuous action has
  finite point stabilisers, as an instance rather than as `Set.Finite` of the carrier.
* `TauCeti.countable_of_properlyDiscontinuousSMul`: a properly discontinuous scalar family on a
  nonempty σ-compact space is countable.
* `TauCeti.locallyFinite_smul_of_isCompact`: under a properly discontinuous action on a weakly
  locally compact space, the translates of a compact set form a locally finite family.
* `TauCeti.discreteTopology_of_locallyFinite_smul`: if the translates of a nonempty set under a
  continuous action are locally finite, then the acting group is discrete.
* `TauCeti.isClosed_iUnion_smul_of_isCompact`: the union of the translates of a closed compact set
  under such an action of a group is closed.
* `TauCeti.isOpenEmbedding_quotientMk_domRestrict_of_disjoint_smul`: the orbit projection is an
  open embedding on an open set disjoint from its nontrivial translates.
* `TauCeti.discreteTopology_of_disjoint_smul`: the existence of a nonempty such open set makes the
  acting topological group discrete.

/-- **A properly discontinuous action has finite point stabilisers**, as a `Finite` instance.

Mathlib's `ProperlyDiscontinuousSMul.finite_stabilizer` (Alex Kontorovich and Heather Macbeth,
`Mathlib/Topology/Algebra/ConstMulAction.lean`) states this as `Set.Finite` of the stabiliser's
carrier. That form does not drive typeclass search, so a count through `Nat.card` — which is the
junk value `0` on an infinite type — has to bridge to `Finite` by hand at each use. This does it
once, for every properly discontinuous action.

For an action of a subgroup of `GL(2, ℝ)` no further instance is needed: Mathlib's
`Subgroup.IsArithmetic.properlyDiscontinuous` supplies proper discontinuity for an arithmetic
`𝒢 ≤ GL(2, ℝ)`, and the image of a finite-index `Γ ≤ SL(2, ℤ)` is arithmetic, so both shapes
reach `Finite` through this instance alone. The stabiliser of a point under `SL(2, ℤ)` itself is
*not* one of those shapes — `SL(2, ℤ)` is a type, not a `Subgroup (GL (Fin 2) ℝ)`, so there is no
`ProperlyDiscontinuousSMul SL(2, ℤ) ℍ` to apply — and stays with the hand-proved
`TauCeti.ModularGroup.finite_stabilizer`. -/
