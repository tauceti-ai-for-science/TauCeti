# Integral subgroups of restricted products

This file packages the everywhere-integral part of a restricted product of groups equipped
with topologies.  The reference family used to form the restricted product and a second family of
subgroups are kept separate, so changing the integral model at finitely many indices is
represented without changing the ambient restricted product.  The resulting openness and
compactness statements are the point-set input for maps and decompositions of restricted
products.

It also names the restricted product of a family of groups relative to a family of reference
subgroups, and its product with a distinguished factor carrying no integrality condition. These
are the shapes in which restricted products appear when a family of local groups is assembled
into an adelic one: the finite adelic points, and the full adelic points with the archimedean
factor set apart.

Every construction and theorem here is also stated for additive groups (`integralAddSubgroup`,
`RestrictedProductAddGroup`, `CompactOpenAddSubgroups`, …).

The eventual comparison results are adapted from the FLT project
(`ImperialCollegeLondon/FLT`, file `TopologicalSpace.lean`, source commit
`bc2fe8ff7396469a16c2a6d51d6117f5825d93a0`, FLT PR #1088, Apache 2.0), whose source file
