# Multilinear maps on finitely many finite-dimensional spaces are continuous

A multilinear map `f : MultilinearMap 𝕜 M N` on finitely many finite-dimensional Hausdorff
topological vector spaces over a complete nontrivially normed field is continuous when addition
and scalar multiplication are continuous in the codomain:
`MultilinearMap.continuous_of_finiteDimensional`. The codomain need only be an additive
commutative monoid. No norm is required on the domain modules or codomain, and no bound on the
map is assumed.

This is the multilinear companion of `LinearMap.continuous_of_finiteDimensional`. Mathlib's
`MultilinearMap.continuous_of_bound` asks for an explicit bound, which is exactly what one does
not have when the multilinear map arrives from algebra — a tensor or symmetric-power
construction, say — rather than from analysis.
