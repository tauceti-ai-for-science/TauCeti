# Continuity of the reduction of `X → R` modulo one vector with a unit coordinate

Over a topological ring `R`, the reduction

`LinearMap.piSplitAtQuot x₀ w hw q : (X → R) →ₗ[R] ({x // x ≠ x₀} → R) × R ⧸ (q)`

of `TauCeti.LinearAlgebra.Quotient.Pi.SpanSingleton`, which sends `u` to the coordinates
`u x - u x₀ * w x` for `x ≠ x₀` together with the class of `u x₀` modulo `q`, is continuous for
the product topology on `X → R` and the quotient topology on `R ⧸ (q)`. Since the coordinate
formula involves only subtraction and multiplication by the constants `w x`, continuity of these
two operations on `R` suffices.

The reduction is also packaged as a continuous homomorphism between the multiplicative type tags
of the two additive groups, which is the form in which it is applied to abelian pro-`p` groups
written multiplicatively.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.ContinuousMonoidHom.piSplitAtQuotMultiplicative`: the reduction as a continuous
  homomorphism `Multiplicative (X → R) →ₜ* Multiplicative (({x // x ≠ x₀} → R) × R ⧸ (q))`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.LinearMap.continuous_piSplitAtQuot`: the reduction is continuous.
* `TauCeti.ContinuousMonoidHom.piSplitAtQuotMultiplicative_ofAdd`: the value of the
  multiplicative form on `ofAdd u` is `ofAdd` of the reduction of `u`.
