# Paths to normalized reflection-pair lifts

A path between two unit vectors maps to a path from the identity to their reflection-pair lift by
Clifford multiplication by the first vector. For the positive-definite real Clifford form, the
Euclidean unit sphere supplies such a path for every pair of unit vectors.

The dimension bound in the real specialization is sharp for this construction: the unit sphere is
path-connected precisely from dimension two onward. The resulting path is the input needed to
place reflection-pair lifts in the identity path component of the compact real Spin group.

## Main results

* `CliffordAlgebra.continuous_spinReflectionPair` shows that continuously varying unit vectors
  determine continuously varying reflection-pair lifts.
* `CliffordAlgebra.joined_one_spinReflectionPair_of_joined` maps a path in a unit quadric to a
  path from the identity to its reflection-pair lift.
* `CliffordAlgebra.joined_one_spinReflectionPair_realCliffordForm_zero` joins every normalized
  reflection-pair lift to the identity in the positive-definite real form of dimension at least two.
