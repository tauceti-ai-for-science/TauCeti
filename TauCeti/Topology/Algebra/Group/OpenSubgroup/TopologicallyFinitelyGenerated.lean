# Open subgroups of a topologically finitely generated compact group

A topologically finitely generated compact group has, for each `n`, only finitely many open
subgroups of index `n`. The reason is the permutation representation: an open subgroup `U` of
index `n` makes `G` act on the `n`-element coset space `G ⧸ U`, and `U` is recovered from that
action as the stabilizer of the trivial coset. Transporting the coset space to `Fin n` turns the
action into a homomorphism `G →* Equiv.Perm (Fin n)` whose kernel, the normal core of `U`, is open;
and a topologically finitely generated group admits only finitely many homomorphisms with open
kernel into a fixed finite group
(`TauCeti.IsTopologicallyFinitelyGenerated.finite_monoidHom_isOpen_ker`).

Counting over all indices, the open subgroups then form a countable family, as do the open normal
subgroups, and the latter can be arranged in a single descending sequence cofinal among them. That
sequence is what lets an inverse-limit argument over the finite quotients be run along `ℕ`, using
Mathlib's `IsCompact.nonempty_iInter_of_sequence_nonempty_isCompact_isClosed` in place of the
directed form.

The same count has a rigidity consequence. A continuous surjective endomorphism `f` of `G` pulls
open subgroups back to open subgroups of the same index, injectively; on each of the finite fibers
of the index an injective self-map is a bijection, so *every* open subgroup of `G` is a preimage
`f ⁻¹' V`. This is the combinatorial half of the Hopf property of a topologically finitely
generated profinite group.

Only compactness of `G` is used, never total disconnectedness: for a connected compact group the
statements below are trivial, since `⊤` is then the one open subgroup. The intended case is of
course a profinite group, where the open subgroups carry all the information.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.IsTopologicallyFinitelyGenerated.finite_openSubgroup_index_eq`: finitely many open
  subgroups of each index.
* `TauCeti.IsTopologicallyFinitelyGenerated.openSubgroup_comap_surjective`: every open subgroup
  is the preimage of an open subgroup along a continuous surjective endomorphism.
* `TauCeti.IsTopologicallyFinitelyGenerated.countable_openSubgroup`,
  `TauCeti.IsTopologicallyFinitelyGenerated.countable_openNormalSubgroup`: countably many open
  subgroups, and countably many open normal subgroups.
* `TauCeti.IsTopologicallyFinitelyGenerated.exists_antitone_openNormalSubgroup_cofinal`: a
  descending sequence of open normal subgroups cofinal among them.

`G` on its `n` cosets, so it is determined by that action together with the trivial coset; both
range over finite sets once the coset space is transported to `Fin n`. -/
