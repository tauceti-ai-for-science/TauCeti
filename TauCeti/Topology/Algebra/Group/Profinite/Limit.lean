# Profinite groups: the finite-quotient limit description

The unbundled workhorse of profinite group theory, phrased for the type-class stack
`[Group G] [TopologicalSpace G] [IsTopologicalGroup G] [CompactSpace G]`
(with `TotallyDisconnectedSpace G` only where needed) so that consumers outside the
`ProfiniteGrp` category can use them directly.

* The limit description: a family of cosets of the open normal subgroups of a compact totally
  disconnected group, compatible along the canonical quotient maps, is realized by a unique
  element of `G` (`existsUnique_forall_mk_eq`; Ribes and Zalesskii, *Profinite Groups*,
  Proposition 1.1.4). This is the unbundled counterpart of `ProfiniteGrp.toLimit_surjective`
  and `ProfiniteGrp.toLimit_injective`, which describe the same identification for the
  `ProfiniteGrp` category. The compactness input is
  `IsCompact.nonempty_iInter_of_directed_nonempty_isCompact_isClosed`.
* Three companion forms of the same identification: a point of `G` is determined by its images
  in the finite quotients (`eq_of_forall_mk_eq`), a map into `G` is continuous as soon as all of
  its finite-quotient shadows are (`continuous_iff_forall_continuous_mk`), and a map into `G` has
  dense range exactly when it surjects onto every finite quotient
  (`denseRange_iff_forall_surjective_mk`).
* The same identification for homomorphisms: a family of homomorphisms `H →* G ⧸ U` compatible
  along the quotient maps is induced by a unique homomorphism `H →* G`
  (`existsUnique_monoidHom_mk'_comp_eq`).
* The same for subgroups: a family `H` of subgroups of the quotients `G ⧸ U` cuts out the closed
  subgroup `limitSubgroup H` of `G` (`isClosed_limitSubgroup`), and when `H` is compatible along
  the quotient maps and `G` is compact, its image in every `G ⧸ U` is exactly `H U`
  (`map_mk'_limitSubgroup`). Conversely a closed subgroup is cut out by its own images
  (`limitSubgroup_map_mk'`), so the two constructions are mutually inverse.
* Sequential reconstruction along a sequence `N : ℕ → Subgroup G` of closed subgroups of a
  compact group with trivial intersection: a coset sequence `x k` has a unique common representative
  if every representative of `x (k + 1)` also represents `x k`
  (`existsUnique_forall_mk_eq_of_iInf_eq_bot`). For decreasing `N`, this is the inverse-limit
  description. When the `N k` are normal and decreasing,
  a compatible sequence of homomorphisms into the quotients `G ⧸ N k` comes from a unique
  homomorphism into `G` (`existsUnique_monoidHom_mk'_comp_eq_of_iInf_eq_bot`); when they are
  normal, a map into `G` is continuous as soon as its composites with the quotient maps are
  (`continuous_iff_forall_continuous_mk_of_iInf_eq_bot`); and when they are open and decreasing
  they form a neighbourhood basis of `1` (`hasAntitoneBasis_nhds_one_of_iInf_eq_bot`). The lower
  `p`-series of a pro-`p` group is a decreasing sequence of closed normal subgroups with trivial
  intersection, and its terms are open when the group is topologically finitely generated.

/-! ### Sequential limit descriptions

The limit description of a profinite group runs over all of its open normal subgroups. When a
sequence `N : ℕ → Subgroup G` of closed subgroups of a compact group `G` has trivial intersection,
a coset sequence `x k` has a unique common representative if every representative of `x (k + 1)`
also represents `x k`: the coset fibers are nested. For decreasing `N`, this is the inverse-limit
description. When the `N k` are normal and decreasing, a compatible sequence of
homomorphisms into the quotients `G ⧸ N k` is induced by a unique homomorphism into `G`; and when
they are normal, continuity of a map into `G` can be tested one quotient at a time. When the `N k`
are open and decreasing, they are a neighbourhood basis of `1`. The lower `p`-series of a pro-`p`
group is a decreasing sequence of closed normal subgroups with trivial intersection, and its terms
are open when the group is topologically finitely generated. -/
