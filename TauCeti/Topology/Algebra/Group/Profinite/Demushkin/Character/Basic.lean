# The canonical character of a Demushkin group

A Demushkin group `G` has exactly one continuous character `χ : G → ℤ_pˣ` with Labute's prescription
property (`TauCeti.HasPrescriptionProperty`): every reduction `H¹(G, I(χ)/pⁱ) → H¹(G, I(χ)/p)` of
the twisted coefficients is surjective (Labute, Theorem 4). This file proves that theorem and
defines the character, `TauCeti.demushkinCharacter`, the *canonical character* or *orientation*
of `G`, whose image is the second invariant of the classification of Demushkin groups.

Write `G = ⟨x₁, …, x_n ∣ r⟩` with `r ∈ Φ(F)` in the free pro-`p` group `F`. A continuous character
`χ` of `G` is determined by its values `u_i = χ(x_i)`, which are principal units `1 + pℤ_p`, and by
the relator criterion
(`TauCeti.presentedProP.hasPrescriptionProperty_iff_forall_isCrossedHom_eq_zero`) it has the
prescription property exactly when every continuous crossed homomorphism `F → ℤ_p` for the induced
character of `F` vanishes at `r`. The existence and uniqueness theorem holds for every
one-relator pro-`p` group whose relator has nondegenerate degree-one form
(`TauCeti.freeProP.degreeOneForm`), a condition every Demushkin group satisfies
(`TauCeti.IsDemushkin.nondegenerate_degreeOneForm`); it needs no normal form of the relator and is
uniform in `p`.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.demushkinCharacter`: the canonical character of a Demushkin group.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.existsUnique_hasPrescriptionProperty_presentedProP_of_nondegenerate`: a one-relator
  pro-`p` group whose relator has nondegenerate degree-one form has exactly one continuous
  character with the prescription property.
* `TauCeti.IsDemushkin.existsUnique_hasPrescriptionProperty`: Labute's Theorem 4, existence and
  uniqueness of the canonical character of a Demushkin group.
* `TauCeti.hasPrescriptionProperty_demushkinCharacter`,
  `TauCeti.HasPrescriptionProperty.eq_demushkinCharacter`,
  `TauCeti.hasPrescriptionProperty_iff_eq_demushkinCharacter`: the canonical character has the
  prescription property, and it is the only character that does.
* `TauCeti.demushkinCharacter_of_equiv`, `TauCeti.range_demushkinCharacter_of_equiv`: the
  canonical character, and its image, are invariant under topological isomorphism, across
  universes.
* `TauCeti.range_demushkinCharacter_eq_of_equiv`: the image of the canonical character of `G` is
  `A` as soon as `G` is isomorphic to a group all of whose characters with the prescription property
  have image `A`; this reads the image table of the normal forms on the canonical character.
* `TauCeti.isClosed_range_demushkinCharacter`: the image of the canonical character is a closed
  subgroup of `ℤ_pˣ`, contained in the principal units
  (`TauCeti.demushkinCharacter_apply_mem_unitsPrincipal_one`).

/-- **A one-relator pro-`p` group whose relator has nondegenerate degree-one form has exactly one
continuous character with the prescription property** (Labute, Theorem 4, without normal forms).
Let `F` be the free pro-`p` group on a finite type `X` and `r ∈ Φ(F)` a relator whose class in
`gr_1(F)` has nondegenerate degree-one form. Then the presented group `⟨X ∣ r⟩` has exactly one
continuous character `χ : ⟨X ∣ r⟩ → ℤ_pˣ` with the prescription property, that is, exactly one
continuous character for which every continuous crossed homomorphism `F → ℤ_p` for the induced
character of `F` vanishes at `r` (the relator criterion,
`TauCeti.presentedProP.hasPrescriptionProperty_iff_forall_isCrossedHom_eq_zero`). -/
