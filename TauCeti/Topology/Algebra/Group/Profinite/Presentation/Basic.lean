# Profinite groups defined by generators and relators

This file constructs profinite and pro-`p` groups from generators and relators. In each case the
relators are quotiented by their **closed** normal closure, so the result remains profinite. The
quotient maps and factorisation theorems let maps out of a presented group be specified on its
generators together with the condition that they kill its relators.

The profinite construction allows finite quotients of any order. The pro-`p` construction starts
with the free pro-`p` group and therefore retains only finite `p`-group quotients.
Both universal properties are used to describe groups by finite sets of generators and relators.

The generators generate a presented group topologically, so a group presented on a finite type is
topologically finitely generated. With no relators the presented group is the free group of the
same kind (`presentedProfiniteGroup.equivFreeProfiniteGroup`, `presentedProP.equivFreeProP`).
Every Hausdorff group that is a continuous image of `freeProfiniteGroup X` or of `freeProP p X`
is presented on `X`, with the kernel as its set of relators
(`presentedProfiniteGroup.equivOfSurjective`, `presentedProP.equivOfSurjective`). Combined with
`IsProP.exists_surjective_freeProP`, a
topologically finitely generated pro-`p` group `G` has a presentation on any finite type with at
least `topologicalGeneratorRankNat G` elements; a presentation on exactly that many generators is
what is called a **minimal presentation** of `G`.

A presented group is functorial in its presentation: a continuous homomorphism of the underlying
free groups that sends the relators of the source into the closed normal closure of the relators
of the target induces a continuous homomorphism of the presented groups, and a topological
isomorphism of the free groups matching the two closed normal closures induces a topological
isomorphism of the presented groups. In particular a presented group depends on its relators only
through their closed normal closure. Finally, the pro-`p` group presented by the images of a set
of profinite relators is a quotient of the profinite group they present.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.presentedProfiniteGroup`, `TauCeti.presentedProP`: the profinite and the pro-`p` group
  presented by a type of generators and a set of relators in the free group of the same kind.
* `TauCeti.presentedProfiniteGroup.mk`, `TauCeti.presentedProP.mk`: the quotient map from the free
  group.
* `TauCeti.presentedProfiniteGroup.of`, `TauCeti.presentedProP.of`: the canonical generators.
* `TauCeti.presentedProfiniteGroup.lift`, `TauCeti.presentedProP.lift`: the continuous
  homomorphism out of a presented group induced by one out of the free group that kills the
  relators.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.presentedProfiniteGroup.existsUnique_lift`, `TauCeti.presentedProP.existsUnique_lift`:
  the universal properties.
* `TauCeti.presentedProfiniteGroup.dense_closure_range_of`,
  `TauCeti.presentedProP.dense_closure_range_of`: the generators generate topologically.
* `TauCeti.presentedProfiniteGroup.isTopologicallyFinitelyGenerated`,
  `TauCeti.presentedProP.isTopologicallyFinitelyGenerated`: a group presented on a finite type is
  topologically finitely generated.
* `TauCeti.presentedProfiniteGroup.equivFreeProfiniteGroup`, `TauCeti.presentedProP.equivFreeProP`:
  with no relators, the presented group is free.
* `TauCeti.presentedProfiniteGroup.equivOfSurjective`, `TauCeti.presentedProP.equivOfSurjective`:
  a continuous image of the free group is presented on `X` by the kernel.
* `TauCeti.IsProP.exists_continuousMulEquiv_presentedProP`: a topologically finitely generated
  pro-`p` group has a presentation on any finite type with at least `topologicalGeneratorRankNat`
  elements.
* `TauCeti.presentedProfiniteGroup.map`, `TauCeti.presentedProP.map`: functoriality in the
  generators and the relators.
* `TauCeti.presentedProfiniteGroup.congr`, `TauCeti.presentedProP.congr`: an isomorphism of the
  free groups matching the relators induces an isomorphism of the presented groups;
  `TauCeti.presentedProP.congrSingleton` is the one-relator case, for an isomorphism carrying the
  relator to the relator.
* `TauCeti.presentedProfiniteGroup.congrOfClosureEq`, `TauCeti.presentedProP.congrOfClosureEq`:
  relators with the same closed normal closure present the same group.
* `TauCeti.presentedProfiniteGroup.toPresentedProP_surjective`: a presented profinite group maps
  onto the pro-`p` group presented by the images of its relators.
* `TauCeti.presentedProPGen`: the generators of a pro-`p` group presented on `Fin n`, indexed by
  `ℕ` with value `1` out of range, as the images of `TauCeti.freeProPGen`.
