# Local trivializations of quotient maps

A continuous local section of the quotient by a subgroup determines a local trivialization of
the quotient map.  On the source `mk ⁻¹' U`, the fiber coordinate of an element `g` is
`s([g])⁻¹ * g`; its membership in the subgroup follows from the section property.  On the target
`U ×ˢ univ`, the inverse chart reconstructs `g` as `s(q) * h`.

This is the standard local product chart for a homogeneous space; see, for example, Husemoller's
*Fibre Bundles*, Chapter 4.

On the source `mk ⁻¹' U`, the chart sends `g` to `([g], s([g])⁻¹ * g)`. On the target
`U ×ˢ univ`, its inverse sends `(q, h)` to `s(q) * h`; outside that target the inverse uses the
