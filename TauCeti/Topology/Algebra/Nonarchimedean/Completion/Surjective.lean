# An open map out of a nonarchimedean group stays open, and an open surjection stays surjective

For a continuous **open** homomorphism `f : G → H` from a first-countable nonarchimedean additive
group to a uniform additive group, the induced map on separated completions is again open; if `f`
is moreover surjective then so is that map. Openness is what the statements turn on: a continuous
surjection alone gives only a dense image in the completion of `H`. Nothing is asked of `H` beyond
being a uniform additive group.

Openness also computes the kernel of the induced map: it is the closure of the image of the kernel
of `f`, and for this first countability is not needed. Together with surjectivity this identifies
the completion of `H` with the quotient of the completion of `G` by that closed subgroup, which is
how completion commutes with passing to an open quotient (Bourbaki, *General Topology*, Chapter IX,
§3.1, Proposition 4, for metrisable groups).

## Main results

* `AddMonoidHom.isOpenMap_completion`: the induced map on completions is open.
* `AddMonoidHom.surjective_completion`: it is surjective when `f` is.
* `AddMonoidHom.ker_completion`: its kernel is the closure of the image of the kernel of `f`.

/-- **The kernel of the map induced on completions by a continuous open homomorphism out of a
nonarchimedean additive group is the closure of the image of the kernel.** Unlike
`AddMonoidHom.surjective_completion`, this needs no first countability.

Openness cannot be dropped: a continuous injective homomorphism can kill a nonzero point of the
completion. The identity of `ℤ`, from the `6`-adic to the `2`-adic topology, induces the
projection `ℤ₂ × ℤ₃ → ℤ₂` on completions. -/
