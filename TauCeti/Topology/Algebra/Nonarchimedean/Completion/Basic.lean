# Completions of nonarchimedean groups and rings

Facts about the Hausdorff completion that need only the additive, resp. ring, structure:
the closure of the image of an open additive subgroup is open, the kernel of the completion map
is the closure of the zero ideal, and integral closedness of an open subring survives completion.
The intrinsic completion of any subring is canonically the closure of its image in the ambient
completion.

They are stated here rather than alongside the Huber-ring theory that uses them, since none
mentions a pair of definition or an adic topology, and they live in the `UniformSpace.Completion`
namespace of the construction they describe, or in the `Subring` namespace for its intrinsic
completion, rather than in a `TauCeti` one.

The integral-closedness result is Huber's Lemma 2.4.3(iv), Wedhorn's Lemma 7.47(4): if `G` is *open*
and integrally closed in `A`, the closure `Ĝ` of its image in `Â` is integrally closed in `Â`.
The proof below is Huber's. The integral closure `H` of `Ĝ` in `Â` contains the open subring
`Ĝ`, hence is open, so every neighbourhood of a point of `H` meets the image of `A` inside `H`.
For such an image `i b`, an integral relation over `Ĝ` is perturbed one coefficient at a time
into a relation whose coefficients come from `G`; openness of `Ĝ` keeps the value of the
perturbed relation at `i b` inside `Ĝ`, and an open `G` is closed, hence exactly the preimage of
`Ĝ`, so that value is the image of an element of `G`. Subtracting it from the constant term
leaves an integral relation for `b` over `G`, so `b ∈ G`, and `i b` therefore lies in the image
of `G`.

## Main results

* `UniformSpace.Completion.isOpen_closure_image_coe`: the closure in `Â` of the image of an open
  additive subgroup of `A` is open, and
  `UniformSpace.Completion.isOpen_topologicalClosure_map_coeRingHom` says the same of an open
  subring.
* `UniformSpace.Completion.preimage_closure_image_coe`: for an *open* subgroup `G`, the preimage
  under `A → Â` of the closure of the image of `G` is `G` itself. With the openness result above
  this is the bijection of Wedhorn's Example 5.33 between the open subgroups of `A` and of `Â`.
* `UniformSpace.Completion.ker_coeRingHom`: the kernel of `A → Â` is the closure of `⊥`.
* `Subring.completionEquivClosure`: the completion of a subring is isomorphic to the closure
  of its image in the ambient completion. It uses Mathlib's
  `Completion.isUniformInducing_extension` and `IsUniformEmbedding.isClosedEmbedding`.
* `UniformSpace.Completion.isIntegrallyClosedIn_topologicalClosure_map_coeRingHom`:
  Huber's Lemma 2.4.3(iv), the closure in `Â` of the image of an open subring of `A` integrally
  closed in `A` is integrally closed in `Â`.

/-- **An open additive subgroup is recovered from the closure of its image.** For `G` open, the
preimage under `A → Â` of the closure of the image of `G` is `G` itself.

For a uniform additive group, this is the injectivity half of the bijection
`G ↦ closure (ι '' G)` between the open subgroups of `A` and those of `Â`
(Wedhorn, Example 5.33); `isOpen_closure_image_coe` says the map lands in open subgroups.
No separation assumption on `A` is needed. Separate continuity of addition suffices for this
preimage equality: an open subgroup is closed, and the completion map induces the topology
on `A`. -/

/-- The one analytic step of Huber's Lemma 2.4.3(iv): an element `y` of the closure `Ĝ` of the
image of an *open* subring `G` can be replaced by the image of an element of `G` so closely that
`Ĝ` still absorbs the error after it is multiplied by an arbitrary `z`.

Openness is exactly what is used: it makes `Ĝ` a neighbourhood of zero, so multiplication by `z`
carries a small enough neighbourhood of `y` back into `Ĝ`, and `y` lies in the closure of the
image of `G`, which supplies a point of that neighbourhood. -/

/-- Huber's Lemma 2.4.3(iv) for a single element of `A`: if the image in `Â` of `b : A` is integral
over the closure `Ĝ` of the image of an open subring `G`, then `b` is already integral over `G`.

An integral relation for the image of `b` over `Ĝ` is perturbed one coefficient at a time by
`exists_mem_coe_sub_mul_mem_topologicalClosure`, which leaves the value of the relation at the
image of `b` inside `Ĝ`. Being open, `G` is closed, hence exactly the preimage of `Ĝ`
(`IsInducing.closure_eq_preimage_closure_image`), so that value is the image of an element of
`G`; subtracting it from the constant term turns the perturbed relation into one over `G`. -/
