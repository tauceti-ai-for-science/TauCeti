# Uniform local connectedness

A set `s` in a pseudometric space is **uniformly locally connected** when the connected sets
joining nearby points can be chosen small *at a rate independent of where they are*: for every
`ε > 0` there is a single `δ > 0` such that any two points of `s` at distance less than `δ` lie in
a connected subset of `s` of diameter at most `ε`.

This is the metric strengthening of local connectedness, and the two notions are *equivalent on a
compact set*. That equivalence is what this file proves:
`IsCompact.isUniformlyLocallyConnected` derives the uniform statement from the local one by
a Lebesgue-number argument, and `TauCeti.IsUniformlyLocallyConnected.locallyConnectedSpace` returns
from the uniform statement to the local one with no compactness at all.

Compactness is genuinely needed for the first direction. The graph of `x ↦ sin (1 / x)` over
`(0, 1]` is homeomorphic to an interval, hence locally connected, but not uniformly so: the
oscillations crowd together as `x → 0`, so two points of equal ordinate on distinct oscillations
come arbitrarily close to one another, while every connected subset of the graph joining them
sweeps out a whole oscillation and so meets ordinates near both `1` and `-1`. Such a set has
diameter at least `2`, so no `δ` works for `ε = 1`. It fails no hypothesis but compactness.

## Why this notion

Local connectedness is a statement about one point at a time, and an argument that must produce a
small connected set near *every* point of a set at once cannot use it directly. The uniform form is
what such arguments actually consume, and on a compact set it costs nothing extra.

The intended consumer is layer **L5** of the conformal-mapping roadmap
(`TauCetiRoadmap/ConformalMapping/README.md`), Carathéodory's boundary correspondence. The
sufficiency half of Carathéodory's continuity theorem — a conformal map of the disc onto a bounded
domain with locally connected boundary extends continuously to the closed disc — controls the image
of a crosscut, and what it asks of the boundary is exactly a uniform `ε`–`δ` supply of small
connected sets joining nearby boundary points. The boundary of a bounded domain is compact, so the
equivalence proved here converts the roadmap's hypothesis into that form once and for all; the
conformal consequences are in `TauCeti/Analysis/Complex/Conformal/Jordan/Domain.lean` and
`TauCeti/Analysis/Complex/Conformal/LocallyConnectedBoundary.lean`.

Nothing here is specific to that application: the definition and both implications are stated for
an arbitrary pseudometric space. Mathlib has `LocallyConnectedSpace` but no metric refinement of
it, and no Lebesgue-number consequence of this shape.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.IsUniformlyLocallyConnected` — the uniform `ε`–`δ` form of local connectedness for a
  set in a pseudometric space.

## Main results

* `IsCompact.isUniformlyLocallyConnected` — a compact locally connected set is uniformly locally
  connected.
* `TauCeti.IsUniformlyLocallyConnected.locallyConnectedSpace` — a uniformly locally connected set
  is locally connected; no compactness is used.
* `TauCeti.IsUniformlyLocallyConnected.exists_isConnected_superset` — a small enough subset is
  enclosed in a small connected subset, at a rate independent of the subset.
* `IsCompact.isUniformlyLocallyConnected_iff` — on a compact set the two notions agree.
* `Convex.isUniformlyLocallyConnected` — a convex set in a real seminormed space is uniformly
  locally connected, with the joining segment as the connected set.
* `TauCeti.isUniformlyLocallyConnected_image_of_isCompact` — a continuous image of a compact,
  locally connected set is uniformly locally connected.

/-- A set `s` is **uniformly locally connected** if for every `ε > 0` there is a `δ > 0` such that
any two points of `s` at distance less than `δ` are joined by a connected subset of `s` of diameter
at most `ε`.

The smallness of the joining set is spelled out as a pairwise distance bound rather than as
`Metric.diam C ≤ ε`, because `Metric.diam` is `0` on an unbounded set, which would let an unbounded
`C` satisfy the condition vacuously. The lemma
`TauCeti.IsUniformlyLocallyConnected.exists_isConnected_diam_le` recovers the diameter phrasing,
boundedness of the joining set being one of its consequences. -/

/-- **A uniformly locally connected set encloses each of its small subsets in a small connected
set.** For every `ε > 0` there is a single `δ > 0` — depending on `s` and `ε` alone — such that
every nonempty bounded subset of `s` of diameter less than `δ` is contained in a connected subset
of `s` of diameter at most `ε`.

This upgrades the two-point statement `TauCeti.IsUniformlyLocallyConnected.exists_isConnected` from
a pair of points to a whole small set, one connected set swallowing the subset entirely. The `δ`
produced is the two-point modulus of `ε / 2`, not of `ε`: the enclosing set is reached from the
fixed point `a` below, so each of its points is allowed only half of the budget.

The enclosing set is built by taking every candidate at once, as in
`TauCeti.IsUniformlyLocallyConnected.locallyConnectedSpace`: fix a point `a` of the subset and
unite every preconnected subset of `s` that contains `a` and stays within `ε / 2` of it. -/

/-! ## The compact case: local connectedness suffices -/

/-- **A compact locally connected set is uniformly locally connected.**

Given `ε > 0`, local connectedness supplies for each point a connected open neighbourhood inside
the ball of radius `ε / 2` about it — the connected component of that ball, open precisely because
the subspace is locally connected. These cover the compact set, and a Lebesgue number `δ` for the
cover does the rest: two points at distance less than `δ` lie in a common ball of radius `δ`, hence
in a common member of the cover, whose points are pairwise within `ε` of one another. -/

/-! ## The converse: uniform local connectedness implies local connectedness -/

/-- **A uniformly locally connected set is locally connected.** No compactness is needed.

The connected neighbourhood of a point `x` of `s` inside a prescribed ball is built by *taking all
candidates at once*: the union of every connected subset of `s` that contains `x` and stays within
`ε / 2` of it. The union is connected because all its members contain `x`, it stays inside the ball
of radius `ε` about `x`, and it is a neighbourhood of `x` in `s` because the uniform hypothesis
puts every point within `δ` of `x` into one of the sets being united. -/
