# Shrinking an open set to separate part of a non-accumulating set

If every point of `K ⊆ V` avoids the closure of `Z \ K`, the open ambient set `V`
shrinks to an open neighbourhood of `K` meeting `Z` in exactly `K ∩ Z`. This is the
localization step for residue computations — a contour region is
shrunk until the only singularities it contains are the intended ones.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.exists_isOpen_inter_eq_of_notMem_closure` (with the accumulation-hypothesis
  corollary `TauCeti.exists_isOpen_inter_eq_of_not_accPt`).
