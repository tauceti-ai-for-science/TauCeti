# The ordinary Steinberg map of a Lie-type index on the Geck carrier

Thirteen of the seventeen Lie-type constructors take an *ordinary* Steinberg endomorphism, the
field Frobenius composed with a graph automorphism of the pinned ambient group; the remaining four
take an odd power of a half-Frobenius instead. `TauCeti.GraphTwistedIndex` is exactly the subtype
of the first thirteen, and `TauCeti.GraphTwistedIndex.diagramPerm` already attaches to each of them
the permutation `σ` of the Bourbaki-numbered simple roots that its graph automorphism realizes.
This file realizes that permutation on the carrier: it produces the graph automorphism
`TauCeti.GraphTwistedIndex.geckGraphAut` of the Geck point group of the index and composes it with
the `q`-power Frobenius, giving `TauCeti.GraphTwistedIndex.geckSteinberg`.

Both halves already exist and are joined rather than rebuilt. On the diagram side,
`TauCeti.GraphTwistedIndex.diagramPerm_mem_diagramSymmetry` reads `σ` as a symmetry of the
Bourbaki-numbered Cartan matrix; on the carrier side, that is exactly what
`TauCeti.DynkinType.geckGraphAutPoints` and `TauCeti.DynkinType.geckTwistedFrobenius` consume. The
work here is the assignment of one to the other, and the resulting equations in the shape milestone
L1 states them, on the numbered root subgroups of `TauCeti.ValidLieTypeIndex.geckRootSubgroup`:

```text
γ (x_i(u)) = x_{σ i}(u),        F (x_i(u)) = x_{σ i}(u ^ q),
```

together with the two relations that milestone requires of the graph factor, namely that `γ`
commutes with the Frobenius and that the twist order recorded by the index annihilates it,
`γ ^ 2 = 1` on `²Aₙ`, `²Dₙ` and `²E₆` and `γ ^ 3 = 1` on `³D₄`.

The nine untwisted families are indices of this subtype too, with `σ = 1`, so the construction is
total on the thirteen ordinary constructors and degenerates to the plain Frobenius exactly where
the printed family name carries no superscript. On the three untwisted families whose diagram is
unimodular that degeneration is
`TauCeti.UnimodularExceptionalIndex.steinberg_eq_geckSteinberg`, which identifies the map built
here with the Steinberg map those three branches already carry, so the uniform map extends the
special case rather than competing with it.

The `geck` prefix is the same disclaimer it carries in
`TauCeti/GroupTheory/SpecificGroups/CFSG/GeckCarrier.lean`. Geck's module is the adjoint module, so
outside the `E₈`, `F₄` and `G₂` diagrams the characters occurring in the carrier generate the root
lattice and not the whole character lattice of the pinned torus, and the carrier is therefore not
yet the simply connected group that milestone L0 asks for. No declaration below asserts that it is,
nor that any group here is finite, perfect or simple, and no fixed-point subgroup is formed on a
branch whose carrier has not been identified.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.GraphTwistedIndex.geckGraphAut`: the graph automorphism of the Geck point group of an
  ordinary Lie-type index, realizing its pinned diagram permutation.
* `TauCeti.GraphTwistedIndex.geckSteinberg`: the ordinary Steinberg map `γ ∘ Frob_q` of that index
  on the same carrier.
* `TauCeti.UnimodularExceptionalIndex.toGraphTwistedIndex`: the three untwisted unimodular
  families `E₈(q)`, `F₄(q)` and `G₂(q)` as ordinary indices.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.GraphTwistedIndex.geckGraphAut_geckRootSubgroup`: the graph automorphism renumbers the
  root subgroups by the diagram permutation and leaves their parameters alone.
* `TauCeti.GraphTwistedIndex.geckGraphAut_geckWeightTorus`: it relabels the coordinates of a
  weight-torus point by the inverse of that permutation.
* `TauCeti.GraphTwistedIndex.geckGraphAut_pow_twistOrder`: the twist order of the index annihilates
  the graph automorphism.
* `TauCeti.GraphTwistedIndex.geckGraphAut_comp_geckFrobenius`: the graph automorphism commutes with
  the Frobenius, so `TauCeti.GraphTwistedIndex.geckSteinberg_eq_geckGraphAut_comp` and
  `TauCeti.GraphTwistedIndex.geckSteinberg_eq_geckFrobenius_comp` are the same map.
* `TauCeti.GraphTwistedIndex.geckSteinberg_geckRootSubgroup`: the Steinberg map raises the
  parameter of every numbered root subgroup to the `q`-th power and renumbers it by the diagram
  permutation.
* `TauCeti.GraphTwistedIndex.geckSteinberg_geckWeightTorus`: it raises every coordinate of a
  weight-torus point to the `q`-th power and relabels them by the inverse of that permutation.
* `TauCeti.GraphTwistedIndex.geckWeightTorus_mem_fixedSubgroup_geckSteinberg`: a weight-torus point
  satisfying the resulting twisted equations `s_{σ⁻¹ k} ^ q = s_k` is fixed by the Steinberg map.
* `TauCeti.GraphTwistedIndex.geckSteinberg_eq_geckFrobenius_of_diagramPerm_eq_one`: on an untwisted
  family it is the Frobenius.
* `TauCeti.UnimodularExceptionalIndex.steinberg_eq_geckSteinberg`: it agrees with the Steinberg map
  already attached to `E₈(q)`, `F₄(q)` and `G₂(q)`.

## Roadmap

This is the carrier layer of milestone L1, "ordinary and graph Steinberg maps", of
`TauCetiRoadmap/CFSGStatement/README.md`, whose completion condition is that "the simple-root-
subgroup equations and the order relations are proved". Those equations and relations are proved
here for all thirteen ordinary indices at once, in the shape the milestone states them and against
the diagram permutations that `TauCeti/GroupTheory/SpecificGroups/CFSG/GraphTwisted.lean` pins.

It does not close L1, and it does not close milestone L0: the carrier is the Geck one, whose
identification with the pinned simply connected Chevalley--Demazure group of
`TauCeti.DynkinType.simplyConnectedRootDatum` is a Layer 9 target of
`TauCetiRoadmap/ReductiveGroups/README.md` that this roadmap consumes rather than proves. This file
stands to `TauCeti/GroupTheory/SpecificGroups/CFSG/Datum/Steinberg.lean` as
`TauCeti/GroupTheory/SpecificGroups/CFSG/GeckCarrier.lean` stands to
`TauCeti/GroupTheory/SpecificGroups/CFSG/Datum/Frobenius.lean`: the same map one layer up, on
points instead of on the root datum.
