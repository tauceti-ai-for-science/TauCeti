# The spin carrier and the candidate group of the untwisted family `Bₙ(q)`

The untwisted odd orthogonal family `Bₙ(q)` is built on the diagram `Bₙ`, and Tau Ceti's explicit
full-weight Chevalley carrier for that diagram is `TauCeti.TypeBSpinCarrier.groupScheme`, the
Kostant toral closure of the split spin representation inside `GL_(2^n)` over `ℤ`, whose weights
span the whole character lattice of the simply connected form. This file attaches that carrier to
a validated type-`B` index: the group of algebraic-closure-valued points of the carrier at the
index's rank, its Bourbaki-numbered simple root subgroups, the reading of their root characters in
the type-`B` root datum the index names, and the carrier's `q`-power Frobenius, where `q` is the
field order the index records. The family is untwisted, so that Frobenius is its Steinberg
endomorphism outright, and the candidate group of the family is the derived subgroup of the
Steinberg fixed points modulo the centre of that derived subgroup,

```text
H_d = fixedSubgroup d.steinberg,        d.Group = [H_d, H_d] / Z([H_d, H_d]).
```

The carrier is indexed by `n` in the spelling `B (n + 1)`, so a validated index of rank `r` uses
the carrier at `TauCeti.TypeBLieIndex.carrierRank`, which is `r - 1`. That subtraction is harmless
because `TauCeti.TypeBLieIndex.two_le_rank` bounds the rank below by two:
`TauCeti.TypeBLieIndex.carrierRank_add_one` recovers `r`, and every numbered object below is indexed
by `Fin d.1.rank`, the upstream Bourbaki index type of the index's own Dynkin type, rather than by a
node of the carrier. The two numberings agree node for node, so
`TauCeti.TypeBLieIndex.carrierNode` is the rank identification and nothing more; that is what
`TauCeti.TypeBLieIndex.rootGeneratorWeight_carrierNode_eq_root_simpleIndex` records, reading the
character of the `i`-th raising subgroup as the `i`-th simple root of the type-`B` root datum the
index names.

The spin carrier takes no rank hypothesis beyond the one the subtype supplies, so everything below
is stated for every validated type-`B` index, the rank-two members `B₂(q)` included. Those members
are also served, beside the Suzuki family that shares their diagram, by the rank-two type-`C`
carrier of `TauCeti/GroupTheory/SpecificGroups/CFSG/TypeB/Two/Basic.lean`, reached through
`TauCeti.TypeB2LieIndex`. The two carriers of the `B₂` diagram are identified with each other, and
the spin carrier of `B₂(q)` with the pinned `Sp₄/ℤ` scheme points, in
`TauCeti/GroupTheory/SpecificGroups/CFSG/TypeB/Two/SpinAgreement.lean`.

The spin carrier rather than the Geck carrier is used because the Geck carrier is built from the
adjoint representation, so its weights span the whole character lattice exactly in the types `E₈`,
`F₄` and `G₂`, by `TauCeti.DynkinType.span_range_geckWeight_eq_top_iff`; the spin representation is
what sees the spinor coset of the type-`B` root lattice, and its weights span the whole weight
lattice, the root lattice together with that coset, by
`TauCeti.TypeBSpinCarrier.span_range_basisWeight_eq_top`.

Nothing here asserts that the carrier is reductive, that its weight torus is maximal, that it is
the spin group scheme or the pinned simply connected Chevalley--Demazure group scheme of type `Bₙ`,
or that any group below is finite, perfect, or simple. The Steinberg endomorphism and the candidate
group transfer to that pinned group scheme only along an identification of the carrier with it,
once one is proved.

/-- **The rank parameter of the spin carrier serving a validated type-`B` index.**
`TauCeti.TypeBSpinCarrier.groupScheme n` is the carrier of type `B (n + 1)`, so the carrier
serving an index of rank `r` is the one at `r - 1`. The subtraction never truncates, `r` being at
least two by `TauCeti.TypeBLieIndex.two_le_rank`; `TauCeti.TypeBLieIndex.carrierRank_add_one` is
the identification that recovers `r`. -/
def carrierRank : ℕ := d.1.rank - 1

/-- The carrier rank of a validated type-`B` index is one less than its rank. -/

its generators by the Bourbaki numbering of the type-`B` diagram that the index names, node for
node. -/

/-- **The node correspondence transports the type-`B` Cartan matrix.** The entry at a pair of

explicit full-weight type-`B` spin Chevalley carrier at the index's rank, over the algebraic
closure of its prime field. It is infinite. No finiteness, reductivity, pinning or maximality
statement is attached to it. In rank two, `TauCeti.TypeB2LieIndex.spinEquivPinned` identifies it
with the points of the pinned `Sp₄/ℤ` group scheme; in higher rank it is not claimed to be the
points of the pinned simply connected group scheme of type `Bₙ`, no such identification being
proved. -/

`TauCeti.DynkinType.simplyConnectedRootDatum` at the Dynkin type the index names. This is the sense
in which the spin carrier serves that diagram; it is not a claim that the carrier is the pinned
group of the diagram, no pinning being constructed for it.

The character itself is `TauCeti.TypeBSpinCarrier.rootGeneratorWeight`, which
`TauCeti.TypeBSpinCarrier.weightTorusPoints_conj_rootSubgroupPoints` exhibits as the one
conjugation by the carrier's split torus rescales the parameter by. -/
