# A transcribed presentation of the third Fischer group

This file carries the `Fi24Prime` row of the sporadic presentation data. The cited source presents
the 3-transposition group `Fi₂₄'·2` and proves that its commutator subgroup is the simple group
`Fi₂₄'`. It also gives the index-two subgroup generators

```text
ab, ac, ad, ae, af, ag, ah, ai, aj, ak.
```

The presentation recorded here is the Reidemeister--Schreier presentation of that commutator
subgroup. An eleventh Schreier generator `al` is retained instead of using the source relation
`l = (abcdefh)⁹` to eliminate it; retaining it keeps every derived relator a direct rewrite of one
displayed source relator.

The source presentation has twelve involutory generators, indexed here as
`a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,k,l`. Its Coxeter graph is

```text
l -- k -- a -- b -- c -- d -- e -- f -- g -- j
                         |
                         h -- i
```

and it has two further relations

```text
l = (a b c d e f h)^9,
(d c b a k l d e f g j d h i)^17 = 1.
```

Sending every source generator to the nontrivial element of `C₂` is the quotient onto
`Fi₂₄'·2 / Fi₂₄'`. With transversal `{1,a}`, the Schreier generator attached to `x` is
`ax`. Because all source generators are involutions, a source letter in an even position, counting
positions from zero, rewrites as `(ax)⁻¹` and one in an odd position as `ax`; conjugating a relator
by `a` exchanges the two signs. Each off-diagonal Coxeter relator and each further relator
therefore contributes those two rewrites. The square relators are precisely the relations used to
eliminate the other half of the Schreier generators: after that elimination each rewrites to
`u⁻¹u` or `uu⁻¹`, so none remains.

Thus the `66` off-diagonal Coxeter relators and two further relators yield `2 · (66 + 2) = 136`
relators on eleven generators. `TauCeti.Sporadic.fi24PrimePresentation_matchesMetadata` checks
this count, while `TauCeti.Sporadic.even_length_of_mem_fi24AutomorphismRelators` checks that every
source relator does lie in the index-two subgroup before the rewrite is applied.

The rewrite drops exactly the source letters equal to `a`, which is
`TauCeti.Sporadic.length_fi24SchreierRewrite`, so the letter count of the row is read off
the source relators rather than off the rewritten ones:
`TauCeti.Sporadic.fi24PrimePresentation_totalLength` records the `1076` letters they contribute.
Neither source publishes a presentation length to check that figure against, and the row claims no
cyclic reduction of its compiled words, so the count states the transcribed data for comparison
with the source rather than checking it against a published number.

Nothing here asserts that the presented group is nontrivial, finite, simple, of any particular
order, or isomorphic to another realization. Kim and Michler prove that the commutator subgroup of
the displayed source presentation is `Fi₂₄'`; Reidemeister--Schreier rewriting transfers that
presentation to the subgroup. That transfer is a theorem here:
`TauCeti.Sporadic.fi24PrimeGroupMulEquivCommutator` identifies the group presented by
the row with the commutator subgroup of the group `TauCeti.Sporadic.Fi24AutomorphismGroup`
presented by the eighty source relators, through the general index-two rewriting theorem
`TauCeti.IsSchreierIndexTwoSource.mulEquivCommutator`. The independent read-through below then
checks the source relators, and only them, against the cited source.

## Independent source-to-Lean read-through

An independent read-through used Kim--Michler, Lemma 6.2. The paper presents twelve involutions
`a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,k,l`. Its eleven exponent-three pairs are

```text
lk, ka, ab, bc, cd, de, ef, fg, gj, dh, hi,
```

and its fifty-five exponent-two pairs are

```text
la,lb,lc,ld,le,lf,lg,lj,lh,li,
kb,kc,kd,ke,kf,kg,kj,kh,ki,
ac,ad,ae,af,ag,aj,ah,ai,
bd,be,bf,bg,bj,bh,bi,
ce,cf,cg,cj,ch,ci, df,dg,dj,
eg,ej,eh,ei, fj,fh,fi, gh,gi, jh,ji,di.
```

These are exactly the eleven undirected pairs in `fi24AutomorphismEdges` and their complement;
`fi24AutomorphismCoxeterMatrix` assigns the edges entry three, every other off-diagonal pair entry
two, and the diagonal entry one. The two remaining source relations have exactly the letters and
exponents recorded by `fi24SourceEquationWord_def` and `fi24SourceLongWord_def`:

```text
l = (a b c d e f h)^9,
(d c b a k l d e f g j d h i)^17 = 1.
```

Thus the source's twelve squares, eleven exponent-three pairs, fifty-five exponent-two pairs, and
two displayed relations account for all `80` entries of `fi24AutomorphismRelators`, with none
dropped or duplicated.

Lemma 6.2(c) identifies the commutator subgroup and gives the generators `ab` through `ak`. The
connected exponent-three graph makes all twelve source generators equal in the abelianization,
`TauCeti.Sporadic.abelianizationOf_fi24AutomorphismGroup_of`, while sending each of them to the
nontrivial element of `C₂` kills all the source relators. Hence that parity map has the commutator
subgroup as its index-two kernel,
`TauCeti.Sporadic.commutator_fi24AutomorphismGroup_eq_ker_fi24ParityHom`. The rewrite
was then checked
definition by definition: `fi24SchreierFactors` toggles the transversal representative after every
source letter, omits `a`, and records `(ax)⁻¹` and `ax` in alternating positions. Starting in the
two possible representatives gives the rewrites of `r` and `a r a`. The twelve square relations
perform the standard elimination of the redundant Schreier generators; each of the remaining
`66 + 2` source relators contributes both rewrites. This gives exactly the `136` relators generated
by `fi24PrimeRelators`, retaining `al` so that the source equation for `l` remains visible.
`fi24PrimePresentation_relatorLetters` exposes the resulting compiled words for kernel-checked
inspection.

## Main definitions

  relators selected for rewriting satisfy the hypotheses of index-two Reidemeister--Schreier
  rewriting.

  Reidemeister--Schreier relators of the source words.

  of the source presented group is the kernel of its parity homomorphism.

Every definition here except the abbreviation `TauCeti.Sporadic.Fi24AutomorphismGroup` has its
body sealed, and each is pinned by a public characteristic equation named after it: the `_def`
theorems below, the evaluation lemmas
`TauCeti.Sporadic.fi24AutomorphismCoxeterMatrix_apply`, `TauCeti.Sporadic.fi24TargetGenerator_val`
and `TauCeti.Sporadic.fi24SchreierFactors_nil`/`_cons`, and the field equations of the presentation
row ending in `TauCeti.Sporadic.fi24PrimePresentation_relatorLetters`, jointly determine every
transcribed relation without unfolding a single body.
