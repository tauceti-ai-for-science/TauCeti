# Triangle group signatures: the spherical and Euclidean parameter triples

A *signature* here is a sorted parameter triple `1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ c` of the presentation
`TauCeti.TriangleGroup a b c`, whose generators are constrained by the relations `x ^ a`, `y ^ b`
and `z ^ c`; the presentation is symmetric in the three parameters, which is why a signature is
written sorted. The **exact** signature of a permutation triple is a further datum, its order
triple `t.orderTriple = (a, b, c)`, the `abc` invariant of a three-point cover
(`TauCeti.PermutationTriple.HasExactOrders`), and the two are not to be conflated. A first
parameter `1` shows the difference most sharply: no condition on a presentation forbids the
parameter triple `(1, b, c)`, whose group is the cyclic group of order `Nat.gcd b c`, whereas an
exact signature with first order `1` is the reduced form `(1, m, m)`, because a monodromy of order
one is the identity and the product relation `σinf * σ1 * σ0 = 1` then makes the other two inverse.
The spherical list is therefore stated in the two readings: `TauCeti.IsSphericalSignature` is the
list of exact signatures, whose five rows are `(1, m, m)`, `(2, 2, m)`, `(2, 3, 3)`, `(2, 3, 4)`
and `(2, 3, 5)`, while `TauCeti.IsSphericalParameterSignature` is the list of presentation
parameters, in which the first row is every sorted triple with first parameter `1`. The geometry
type of a triple with exact orders `(a, b, c)` is the sign of the orbifold characteristic.

The orbifold Euler characteristic of a signature is

`χᵒʳᵇ(a, b, c) = 1/a + 1/b + 1/c - 1 ∈ ℚ`,

and its sign is the trichotomy of the triangle groups: a positive signature is spherical, one whose
reciprocal sum is exactly one is Euclidean, and one with a smaller sum is hyperbolic. The last two
are infinite, by `TauCeti.TriangleGroup.infinite_of_inv_add_inv_add_inv_le_one`.

This file classifies the finite lists of the triangle-group classification by an elementary case
analysis on the reciprocal sum. The spherical parameters are those with a first parameter `1`,
those with a repeated `2`, and the three polyhedral triples `(2, 3, 3)`, `(2, 3, 4)` and
`(2, 3, 5)`; among exact signatures the first row is the reduced form `(1, m, m)`, so the exact
spherical list is the five rows `(1, m, m)`, `(2, 2, m)`, `(2, 3, 3)`, `(2, 3, 4)` and `(2, 3, 5)`.
The Euclidean signatures are `(3, 3, 3)`, `(2, 4, 4)` and `(2, 3, 6)`, the same three triples in
both readings. The classification is what the trichotomy amounts to for finiteness: a signature
outside the spherical parameters gives an infinite group, while the cyclic and dihedral rows give
finite groups, of order `Nat.gcd b c` and `2m` by `natCard_one` and `natCard_two_two`, so in
particular the signatures `(1, m, m)` and `(2, 2, m)` have orders `m` and `2m`. The three
polyhedral rows give the finite groups `A₄`, `S₄` and `A₅`, of orders `12`, `24` and `60` by
`natCard_two_three_three`, `natCard_two_three_four` and `natCard_two_three_five`, the orders the
spherical table records as `2 / χᵒʳᵇ`. So a sorted positive signature gives a finite triangle
group exactly when it is a spherical parameter signature. The formula `2 / χᵒʳᵇ` is a statement
about the exact rows, where `2 / χᵒʳᵇ(1, m, m) = m` and `2 / χᵒʳᵇ(2, 2, m) = 2m` are the orders
just proved, while an unreduced parameter triple `(1, b, c)` has order `Nat.gcd b c`, which is
`2 / χᵒʳᵇ(1, b, c)` only when `b = c`.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.orbifoldEulerChar`: the orbifold Euler characteristic `1/a + 1/b + 1/c - 1` of a
  signature.
* `TauCeti.IsSphericalSignature`: the five rows of the spherical table, read on exact signatures.
* `TauCeti.IsSphericalParameterSignature`, `TauCeti.IsEuclideanSignature`: the classified lists read
  on presentation parameters, where the cyclic row is every sorted triple with first parameter `1`,
  and the Euclidean rows, which are the same in both readings.

None of the three predicates exposes its body. Each carries a `Decidable` instance, so `decide`
works on a concrete signature, and a public characteristic lemma
`TauCeti.isSphericalSignature_rows_iff`, `TauCeti.isSphericalParameterSignature_rows_iff` or
`TauCeti.isEuclideanSignature_rows_iff`, which is how a signature is read.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.orbifoldEulerChar` and `TauCeti.orbifoldEulerChar_def`: the orbifold Euler
  characteristic `1/a + 1/b + 1/c - 1`, whose unexposed definition is given its value by the `simp`
  equation `orbifoldEulerChar a b c = (a : ℚ)⁻¹ + (b : ℚ)⁻¹ + (c : ℚ)⁻¹ - 1`. That equation is the
  single simplification level of the orbifold characteristic, and the sign is read off the formula
  it exposes.
* `TauCeti.orbifoldEulerChar_pos_iff`, `TauCeti.orbifoldEulerChar_eq_zero_iff`,
  `TauCeti.orbifoldEulerChar_neg_iff`: the sign of the orbifold Euler characteristic, as
  characterisations of the reciprocal sum against `TauCeti.orbifoldEulerChar_def`.
* `TauCeti.isSphericalSignature_rows_iff`, `TauCeti.isSphericalParameterSignature_rows_iff`,
  `TauCeti.isEuclideanSignature_rows_iff`: the rows of each classified list, as simp lemmas.
* `TauCeti.isSphericalParameterSignature_iff`, `TauCeti.isEuclideanSignature_iff`: the
  classification of the two finite lists of presentation parameters, under `1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ c`.
* `TauCeti.parameterSignature_trichotomy`: every sorted positive signature is spherical, Euclidean
  or hyperbolic, stated on presentation parameters.
* `TauCeti.not_isEuclideanSignature_of_isSphericalParameterSignature` and
  `TauCeti.not_isSphericalParameterSignature_of_isEuclideanSignature`, with
  `TauCeti.not_isEuclideanSignature_of_isSphericalSignature` and
  `TauCeti.not_isSphericalSignature_of_isEuclideanSignature` on exact signatures: the two
  classified lists are disjoint.
* `TauCeti.TriangleGroup.infinite_of_not_isSphericalParameterSignature`: a signature whose
  parameters are not a row of the spherical table gives an infinite triangle group.
* `TauCeti.TriangleGroup.finite_iff_isSphericalParameterSignature`: a sorted positive signature
  gives a finite triangle group exactly when its parameters are a row of the spherical table.
* `TauCeti.PermutationTriple.geometryType_eq_spherical_iff_orbifoldEulerChar_pos` and its
  Euclidean and hyperbolic counterparts: the sign of the orbifold characteristic is the geometry
  type of a triple with exact orders `(a, b, c)`.
* `TauCeti.PermutationTriple.geometryType_eq_spherical_iff_isSphericalSignature`: the spherical
  classification read on exact signatures, where the cyclic row is the reduced form `(1, m, m)`.

`(a, b, c)`, as an element of `ℚ`. The definition is kept unexposed, and its value is given by the
`@[simp]` equation `TauCeti.orbifoldEulerChar_def`; the three sign characterisations below and the

simplification rule for the orbifold Euler characteristic: simplification reduces
`orbifoldEulerChar a b c` to `1/a + 1/b + 1/c - 1`, and the sign is then read off that expression.
This is why the three sign characterisations below carry no `simp` attribute of their own: as `simp`
lemmas they would be duplicates of this equation. -/

/-- A sorted positive triple is a **spherical signature** when it is one of the five rows of the
spherical table `(1, m, m)`, `(2, 2, m)`, `(2, 3, 3)`, `(2, 3, 4)` and `(2, 3, 5)`, the exact
signatures of positive orbifold Euler characteristic. The cyclic row is the reduced form
`(1, m, m)`: the group `TriangleGroup 1 b c` is cyclic of order `Nat.gcd b c`, and it is exactness,
not the presentation, that forces `b = c`, by
`TauCeti.PermutationTriple.second_eq_third_of_hasExactOrders_one`. A triple of exact orders
`(a, b, c)`, sorted, is spherical exactly when it is a row, by
`TauCeti.PermutationTriple.geometryType_eq_spherical_iff_isSphericalSignature`.

Two of the five rows have a free entry, so the ordering conjuncts are stated here rather than left
implicit: without them the degenerate triples `(1, 0, 0)` and `(2, 2, 0)` would pass as signatures,
although neither is a signature and their orbifold Euler characteristics are `0`, not positive.
`TauCeti.IsEuclideanSignature` needs no conjuncts of its own, all three of its rows being concrete.

/-- A **spherical parameter signature** is a sorted positive parameter triple whose first parameter
is `1`, or whose first two parameters are `2`, or which is one of the three polyhedral triples
`(2, 3, 3)`, `(2, 3, 4)` and `(2, 3, 5)`. These are exactly the presentation parameters of
positive orbifold Euler characteristic, by `TauCeti.isSphericalParameterSignature_iff`.

The first branch is a statement about presentation parameters, and the monodromy orders are only
required to divide the presentation parameters: among exact signatures it is therefore the
reduced form `(1, m, m)`, by
