# Artin coefficients of the symmetric group on three points

The coefficient of the trivial subgroup is `-3`, those of the three point stabilizers
and the alternating subgroup are `1`, and that of the whole group is `0`.
These are integral coefficients: they can be used in induction identities in every
characteristic, including characteristics two and three.
