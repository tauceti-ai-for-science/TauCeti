# The fibres of `b ↦ b ^ q + b` over a field with `q²` elements

Let `K` be a finite field with `q²` elements, where `q = p ^ n` is a power of the
characteristic. The map `T b = b ^ q + b` is additive, and it is the trace from `K` to its
subfield with `q` elements, although that subfield plays no role in the statement here. Every
`c` with `c ^ q = c` has exactly `q` preimages under `T`.

The kernel of `T` consists of roots of `X ^ q + X`, and its image of roots of `X ^ q - X`, since
`(b ^ q + b) ^ q = b ^ (q²) + b ^ q = b + b ^ q`. So both have at most `q` elements. Their
product is `|K| = q²`, so both have exactly `q` elements. The image is then the whole root set
of `X ^ q - X` in `K`, and each fibre over it is a coset of the kernel.

This is the count behind the order `q³` of the translation group of the Hermitian function
field: for `a ∈ K`, the element `c = a ^ (q + 1)` satisfies `c ^ q = c`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.FiniteField.natCard_pow_add_self_eq`: `#{b | b ^ q + b = c} = q` whenever
  `c ^ q = c`.
