# Squarefree polynomials with prescribed factorization patterns over finite fields

This file constructs two squarefree factorization patterns over finite fields that are used to
exhibit a large symmetric Galois group by reduction modulo primes:

* degrees `(1, n - 1)`, whose Frobenius cycle type is an `(n - 1)`-cycle with one fixed point,
  which makes a transitive group doubly transitive;
* exactly one factor of degree `2` and all other factor degrees odd, whose Frobenius cycle type
  has an odd power that is a transposition.

These patterns are inputs to the three-prime realization of the full symmetric group `Sₙ` as a
Galois group over `ℚ`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.exists_monic_squarefree_map_natDegree_normalizedFactors_eq_pair_one_sub_one`: for
  `2 ≤ n`, a monic squarefree polynomial of degree `n` whose factor degrees are `{1, n - 1}`.
* `TauCeti.exists_monic_squarefree_count_two_map_natDegree_normalizedFactors_eq_one_and_odd`:
  for `2 ≤ n`, a monic squarefree polynomial of degree `n` with exactly one quadratic irreducible
  factor and all other irreducible factors of odd degree.

## References

* B. L. van der Waerden, *Algebra* I, §61, for the three-prime realization of `Sₙ` over `ℚ` that
  these patterns feed.

/-- For `2 ≤ n`, a finite field has a monic squarefree polynomial of degree `n` with exactly one
irreducible factor of degree `2`, all of whose other irreducible factors have odd degree.

For `n = 2` the polynomial is irreducible quadratic; for odd `n` the factors have degrees `2` and
`n - 2`; for even `n ≥ 4` they have degrees `2`, `1` and `n - 3`. -/
