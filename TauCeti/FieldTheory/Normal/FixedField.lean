# The fixed field of the automorphism group of a normal extension

For a normal extension `E / F`, the fixed field `E ^ Aut(E/F)` sits between `F` and `E` with
`F ⊆ E ^ Aut(E/F)` purely inseparable and `E ^ Aut(E/F) ⊆ E` Galois. This is the splitting of
Stacks, Fields, Lemma 9.27.3(2), whose proof reads "We set `E_insep = E^{Aut(E/F)}`. Details
omitted." Mathlib has the Galois half as `IsGalois.of_fixed_field`; the purely inseparable half
is new here. The two are stated separately, one conclusion each.

Order matters for the consumer (`TauCeti.IsIntegralClosure.finite_of_forall_isPurelyInseparable`):
the purely inseparable step has to sit *below* the separable one, because the integral closure
of a polynomial ring in a separable extension is no longer a polynomial ring.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.IntermediateField.isPurelyInseparable_fixedField_top`: for `E / F` normal, the fixed
  field of `Gal(E/F)` is purely inseparable over `F`.

## Provenance

The mathematics is Stacks, Fields, Lemma 9.27.3(2) (tag 030M), the splitting used by Stacks
10.161.12 (tag 032N) in its normalization-finiteness argument.

/-- Source: Stacks, Fields, Lemma 9.27.3(2): "`F ⊂ E_insep` is purely inseparable", with
`E_insep = E^{Aut(E/F)}` (proof: "Details omitted"). For a normal extension `E / F`, the fixed
field of the full automorphism group is purely inseparable over `F`: an element fixed by every
automorphism has a single conjugate, since `minpoly F x` splits in `E` and its roots form one
orbit. -/
