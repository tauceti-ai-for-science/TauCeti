# Finiteness of the automorphism group of a hyperelliptic function field

Let `k` be an algebraically closed field of characteristic other than two and `F / k` a function
field of genus `g ≥ 2` with a rational subfield `k(x)` of index two. Every `k`-automorphism of `F`
preserves `k(x)` and permutes the `2g + 2 ≥ 6` branch places of `k(x)`; an automorphism whose
restriction to `k(x)` fixes all of them fixes `k(x)` pointwise, by rigidity in genus zero, so it
is the identity or the hyperelliptic involution. Hence `Aut(F / k)` is finite, of order at most
`2 · (2g + 2)!`. This is the hyperelliptic case of the finiteness of the automorphism group of a
function field of genus at least two.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.branchPermHom`: the action of `Aut(F / k)` on the branch places of `k(x)`, evaluated by
  `TauCeti.branchPermHom_apply` and `TauCeti.branchPermHom_symm_apply`.
* `TauCeti.ker_branchPermHom`: its kernel is the group of automorphisms over `k(x)`.
* `TauCeti.finite_algEquiv_of_finrank_adjoin_eq_two`: **`Aut(F / k)` is finite**, and
  `TauCeti.card_algEquiv_le_of_finrank_adjoin_eq_two`: of order at most `2 · (2g + 2)!`.

fixes `k(x)` pointwise by rigidity; conversely an automorphism fixing `k(x)` pointwise restricts to
