# Finite extensions of the constant field

A finite extension of constants yields a finite compositum over the original field, and a
separable extension of constants produces a separable compositum.  Exactness of the original
constant field is needed for neither.  The function-field theorem for arbitrary algebraic
extensions of constants is in `ConstantExtension.Algebraic`.

Under the hypotheses that make constant field extensions well behaved — the original constant
field `k` is exact in `F` and `k' / k` is separable — the compositum acquires no new separable
constants: no element of `F · k'` outside `k'` is separable over `k'`.  Perfectness of `k'` upgrades
this to exactness: when `k'` is perfect — for instance when `k` is perfect and `k' / k` is
algebraic — every algebraic element is separable over `k'`, so `k'` is the full field of constants
of `F · k'`.  Perfectness cannot simply be dropped: over an imperfect `k` an inseparable constant
field extension can enlarge the field of constants beyond `k'`.  For instance,
`k = 𝔽_p(t, u)` is exact in `F = k(x, y)` with `y ^ p = t * x ^ p + u`, but for `k' = k(t ^ (1/p))`
the element `y - t ^ (1/p) * x` of `F · k'` is a `p`-th root of `u`, and `u ^ (1/p) ∉ k'`.

Finite extensions of constants with as many elements as desired always exist, realized as
composita inside an algebraic closure of `F`.  Over a finite constant field this is how arguments
that need many constants, such as choosing a vector outside finitely many proper subspaces, are
carried out after a finite constant field extension.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.finiteDimensional_of_constantCompositum_eq_top`: a compositum with finite constants
  is finite over the original field.
* `TauCeti.finiteDimensional_base_of_constantCompositum_eq_top`: conversely, for an exact `k` and
  separable `k' / k`, a compositum finite over the original field has finite constants.
* `TauCeti.isSeparable_of_constantCompositum_eq_top`: the compositum of a separable constant
  field extension is separable over the original field.
* `TauCeti.separableClosure_eq_bot_of_constantCompositum_eq_top`: for a separable constant field
  extension of an exact constant field, `k'` is separably closed in `F · k'`.
* `TauCeti.isIntegrallyClosedIn_of_constantCompositum_eq_top`: for a separable constant field
  extension by a perfect `k'`, in particular over a perfect `k`, `k'` is the exact constant field
  of `F · k'` (Stichtenoth, Proposition 3.6.1(a)).
* `TauCeti.adjoin_image_eq_top_of_constantCompositum_eq_top`: generators of `F` over `k` generate
  `F · k'` over `k'`.

/-! ### The constant field of the compositum -/

/-- **The enlarged constant field is separably closed in the compositum**: if `k` is the exact
constant field of `F` and `k' / k` is separable algebraic, then every element of `F · k'` that is
separable over `k'` is already a constant of `k'`.

This is Stichtenoth, Proposition 3.6.1(a), with perfectness of `k` replaced by the separability of
the constant in question; `TauCeti.isIntegrallyClosedIn_of_constantCompositum_eq_top` recovers the
statement of record over a perfect `k`. -/

/-- **The constant field of a constant field extension** (Stichtenoth, Proposition 3.6.1(a)):
if `k` is the exact constant field of `F`, `k' / k` is separable and `k'` is perfect, then the
compositum `F · k'` has exact constant field `k'`.  Stichtenoth's hypotheses — `k` perfect and
`k' / k` algebraic — are the special case in which `Algebra.IsSeparable k k'` is inferred and
`PerfectField k'` is `Algebra.IsAlgebraic.perfectField k`.

Together with `TauCeti.IsFunctionField.of_constantCompositum_eq_top` from
`ConstantExtension.Algebraic`, this makes `F · k' / k'` a function field with exact constant field
for an algebraic `k' / k`, so that its genus, its places and their degrees are the ones the theory
of constant field extensions compares with those of `F / k`. -/
