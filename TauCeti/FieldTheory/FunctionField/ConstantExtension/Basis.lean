# Bases of constants in a constant field extension

Let `F' = F · k'` be the compositum of a field `F` with a separable extension `k'` of a field `k`
that is relatively algebraically closed in `F`; the case of interest is a constant field extension
of an algebraic function field `F / k` with exact constant field `k`.  Linear disjointness of `F`
and `k'` over `k` makes `F'` behave like `F ⊗[k] k'`: the image in `F'` of a `k`-basis of `k'` is
an `F`-basis of `F'`, the coordinates of a constant in this basis are the images of its
coordinates over `k`, the trace from `F'` to `F` of a constant is the image of its trace from `k'`
to `k`, and the trace dual of a basis of constants is the basis of constants attached to the trace
dual over `k`.

These are the linear-algebraic inputs to the local theory of constant field extensions: at every
place `P` of `F / k` a basis of constants is an integral basis, which is what identifies the
functions of `F' = F · k'` with bounded poles in terms of those of `F`.

## Main definitions and results

* `TauCeti.finrank_le_finrank_of_constantCompositum_eq_top`: `[F · k' : F] ≤ [k' : k]` for any
  finite `k' / k`, with no exactness or separability hypothesis.
* `TauCeti.constantBasis`: the `F`-basis of `F' = F · k'` given by a `k`-basis of `k'`.
* `TauCeti.constantBasis_repr_algebraMap`: the coordinates of a constant in a basis of constants
  are the images of its coordinates over `k`.
* `TauCeti.trace_algebraMap_of_constantCompositum_eq_top`: the trace of a constant is the image
  of its trace over `k`.  This is Mathlib's `Subalgebra.LinearDisjoint.trace_algebraMap` for the
  linearly disjoint pair `F`, `k'`, stated for the trace over the field `F` itself rather than
  over its image in `F'`.
* `TauCeti.traceDual_constantBasis`: the trace dual of a basis of constants.
