# The order of a Weil differential is a local invariant

The divisor `(ω)` of a nonzero Weil differential of an algebraic function field `F / k` with exact
constant field is the greatest divisor `D` with `ω ∈ Ω_F(D)`, a condition on *all* the places at
once.  Its coefficient `v_P (ω)` at a single place is nevertheless determined by the local
component `ω_P` alone:

`v_P (ω) = max {m : ℤ | ω_P z = 0 whenever v_P z ≤ exp m}`.

That the maximum is attained by `v_P (ω)` is the bound `ω ∈ Ω_F ((ω))` read at `P`; that nothing
larger belongs to the set is the maximality of `(ω)`, applied to the divisor obtained from `(ω)`
by resetting its coefficient at `P` to `m` — the other coefficients are unchanged, so the
local-component criterion for membership in `Ω_F` needs only the hypothesis at `P`.

This is the half of Stichtenoth, *Algebraic Function Fields and Codes*, 2nd ed.,
Proposition 1.7.3(a) that mentions the divisor `(ω)`; the other half, that `ω_P` never vanishes
identically, is in `TauCeti.FieldTheory.FunctionField.Differential.LocalNonvanishing`.

At a **rational** place the characterization sharpens to a single value: writing `r = v_P (ω)`,
some function with a pole of order at most `r + 1` at `P` is not killed by `ω_P`, and subtracting
a constant multiple of `t ^ (-r - 1)` from it — possible because the residue field is `k` — lands
in the part `ω_P` does kill.  So `ω_P` is already nonzero on the single power `t ^ (-r - 1)` of
any uniformizer `t`.  This is what pins down the normalization of the canonical Weil differential
of the rational function field.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.isGreatest_weilDifferentialOrder` and `TauCeti.le_weilDifferentialOrder_iff`: the order
  `v_P (ω)` is the largest bound the local component `ω_P` respects (Stichtenoth,
  Proposition 1.7.3(a)).
* `TauCeti.repartitionDualComponent_uniformizer_zpow_ne_zero`: at a rational place, `ω_P` is
  nonzero on `t ^ (-v_P (ω) - 1)` for every uniformizer `t`.

/-- **At a rational place the order of a nonzero Weil differential is attained on a power of any
uniformizer**: with `r = v_P (ω)` and `t` a uniformizer at `P`, the local component `ω_P` does not
kill `t ^ (-r - 1)`.

So at a rational place a single power of a uniformizer already detects the order, which is what
lets a normalization prescribe one value of one local component. -/
