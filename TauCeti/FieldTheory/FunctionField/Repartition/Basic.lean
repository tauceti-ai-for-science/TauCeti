# Repartitions of an algebraic function field

A **repartition** (Chevalley's name; Stichtenoth says *adele*) of an algebraic function field
`F / k` is a family `a : Place k F → F` of elements of `F` itself — no completions are taken —
that is integral at all but finitely many places.  They form the repartition space

`A_F = {a : Place k F → F | ∀ᶠ P in cofinite, v_P (a P) ≤ 1}`,

filtered by the subspaces

`A_F(D) = {a : Place k F → F | ∀ P, v_P (a P) ≤ exp (D P)}`

attached to the divisors `D` of `F / k`.  This file constructs both, embeds `F` diagonally,
and proves the basic calculus of the filtration: it is monotone and directed, it exhausts
`A_F`, and it cuts the diagonal copy of `F` in exactly the Riemann–Roch space `L(D)`.

It is Stichtenoth, *Algebraic Function Fields and Codes*, 2nd ed., Definitions 1.5.2 and 1.5.3,
together with the elementary lemmas that Section I.5 uses without numbering them, and the
repartitions `ι_P x` supported at a single place from his Definition 1.7.1.  The
quotients `A_F(E)/A_F(D)` and `A_F ⧸ (A_F(D) + F)`, the index of specialty, and Weil
differentials are the work that consumes this file.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.repartitionSpace`: the repartition space `A_F` (Definition 1.5.2), as a
  `k`-subspace of `Place k F → F`.
* `TauCeti.adeleFiltration`: the subspace `A_F(D)` attached to a divisor (Definition 1.5.3).
* `TauCeti.diagonalRepartitions`: the diagonal copy of `F` inside `Place k F → F`, the image of
  `Pi.constAlgHom`.
* `TauCeti.submoduleOfAdeleFiltrationSupDiagonalRepartitions`: the subspace `(A_F(D) + F) ∩ A_F`
  of `A_F`, whose cokernel computes the index of specialty.
* `TauCeti.repartitionMul`: multiplication of a repartition by a function, as a `k`-algebra map
  to the `k`-linear endomorphisms of `A_F`.
* `TauCeti.singleRepartition`: the repartition `ι_P x` carrying the entry `x` at a single place
  `P`, as a `k`-linear map `F →ₗ[k] A_F`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.mem_repartitionSpace_iff_finite` and `TauCeti.mem_adeleFiltration_iff`: the two
  membership conditions, cofinite integrality and the pointwise bound.
* `TauCeti.adeleFiltration_le_repartitionSpace`, `TauCeti.adeleFiltration_mono` and
  `TauCeti.directed_adeleFiltration`: the filtration lands in `A_F`, and is monotone and
  directed.
* `TauCeti.adeleFiltration_sup`: `A_F(D ⊔ E) = A_F(D) + A_F(E)`, the place-by-place splitting.
* `TauCeti.repartitionSpace_eq_iSup` and `TauCeti.coe_repartitionSpace_eq_iUnion`:
  `A_F = ⋃_D A_F(D)`, the exhaustion.
* `TauCeti.diagonalRepartitions_le_repartitionSpace`: the diagonal `F ↪ A_F`, which is where
  the finiteness of the zeros and poles of a function enters.
* `TauCeti.diagonalRepartitions_inf_adeleFiltration`: `F ∩ A_F(D) = L(D)`, the lemma that ties
  the filtration to the Riemann–Roch spaces, and its relative form
  `TauCeti.adeleFiltration_inf_sup_diagonalRepartitions`:
  `A_F(E) ∩ (A_F(D) + F) = A_F(D) + L(E)` for `D ≤ E`.
* `TauCeti.smul_mem_adeleFiltration_iff` and
  `TauCeti.smul_mem_adeleFiltration_sub_principal`: multiplying by a function `z` translates the
  filtration by `div z`, exactly as it does for Riemann–Roch spaces.
* `TauCeti.smul_mem_repartitionSpace` and `TauCeti.smul_mem_diagonalRepartitions`: both `A_F`
  and the diagonal are stable under multiplication by a function.
* `TauCeti.singleRepartition_mem_adeleFiltration_iff`: the bound defining `A_F(D)` is a condition
  at the single place `P` on the repartitions supported there.

## Implementation notes

Both membership conditions are stated **multiplicatively**, as `v_P (a P) ≤ exp (D P)`, and never
in the additive form `ord_P (a P) ≥ -D P`.  The additive form is wrong as written: the junk value
`ord_P 0 = 0` would throw the zero entries out of `A_F(D)` at every place where `D P < 0`, so the
additive carrier is not even closed under addition.  With the multiplicative condition,
`v_P 0 = 0 ≤ exp (D P)` holds at every place, so `A_F(D)` contains `0` definitionally.  This is
the same convention as `TauCeti.riemannRochSpace`, entrywise, which is what makes
`TauCeti.diagonalRepartitions_inf_adeleFiltration` hold on the nose.

`A_F` is pinned as a `Submodule k`, because a Weil differential is by definition a `k`-linear
form on it.  Its multiplicative structure is not lost: `TauCeti.one_mem_repartitionSpace` and
`TauCeti.mul_mem_repartitionSpace` record that it is a subring, and
`TauCeti.smul_mem_repartitionSpace` records the `F`-scalar multiplication that the `F`-vector
space structure on the Weil differentials is built from.

`ι_P x` is built from `Finsupp.lsingle P`, not from `Pi.single` or `LinearMap.single`: the latter
two carry a `DecidableEq` argument, and no instance supplies a decidable equality of places, while
`Finsupp.single` needs none.  `TauCeti.singleRepartition_self` and
`TauCeti.singleRepartition_of_ne` determine `ι_P x` entrywise, so nothing downstream has to
mention `Finsupp`.

The integrality condition is the multiplicative `v_P (a P) ≤ 1`, which is junk-free at zero
entries, and the "all but finitely many" is `Filter.cofinite`; the equivalent finite-exceptional-
set form is `TauCeti.mem_repartitionSpace_iff_finite`. -/
