# Residues under a change of uniformizer

Let `P` be a rational place of `F / k` and let `s` and `t` both have order one at `P`. The
residue of a function `z` with respect to `s` can be computed from Laurent expansions in `t`:

`res_{P,s}(z) = coeff_{-1} (z(T) * s'(T))`,

where `z(T)` and `s(T)` are the Laurent expansions of `z` and `s` in `t` and `s'(T)` is the
formal derivative. This is the expansion-level form of Stichtenoth's transformation formula
`res_{P,s}(z) = res_{P,t}(z · ds/dt)` (Proposition 4.2.9). As a corollary, whenever a function
`w` has expansion `s'(T)` in `t`, `res_{P,s}(z) = res_{P,t}(z * w)`. The function-field derivative
`ds/dt` is such a `w` when `t` is separating
(`TauCeti.Place.laurentSeriesExpansion_derivativeOfSeparating`), which gives the formula in
Stichtenoth's form (`TauCeti.Place.residue_eq_residue_mul_derivativeOfSeparating`).

The formula holds in every characteristic. Both sides are `k`-linear in `z` and vanish on
functions integral at `P`, so it suffices to compare them on the negative powers `s ^ j`. There
it is the formal identity `PowerSeries.coeff_neg_one_coe_zpow_mul_derivative` for the expansion
of `s`, a power series of order one.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.Place.residue_eq_coeff_laurentSeriesExpansion_mul_derivative`: the residue with
  respect to `s`, computed from Laurent expansions in `t`.
* `TauCeti.Place.residue_eq_residue_mul`: `res_{P,s}(z) = res_{P,t}(z * w)` for a function `w`
  whose expansion in `t` is the derivative of that of `s`.
