# Places that split completely in an extension of function fields

Let `F' / k'` be a finite extension of `F / k`. A place `P` of `F / k` **splits completely**
when it has `[F' : F]` distinct extensions to `F' / k'`, the largest number allowed by the
fundamental inequality. This is Stichtenoth, *Algebraic Function Fields and Codes*, 2nd ed.,
Definition 3.1.13.

For a separable extension, the fundamental identity

`sum_{P' | P} e(P' | P) * f(P' | P) = [F' : F]`

shows that complete splitting is equivalent to every place above `P` having ramification index
and relative degree both equal to one. In the Galois case these invariants are constant on the
fibre, so it is enough to check either one place above `P`. Equivalently, the decomposition group
of such a place is trivial.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.Place.IsSplitCompletely`: a place has `[F' : F]` extensions.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.Place.isSplitCompletely_iff_forall_ramificationIdx_eq_one_and_relativeDegree_eq_one`:
  the non-Galois characterization by trivial ramification and residue extensions.
* `TauCeti.Place.isSplitCompletely_iff_ramificationIdx_eq_one_and_relativeDegree_eq_one`:
  in a Galois extension it is enough to test one place in the fibre.
* `TauCeti.Place.isSplitCompletely_iff_decompositionSubgroup_eq_bot`: in a Galois extension,
  complete splitting is equivalent to a trivial decomposition group.

## Provenance

The orbit--stabilizer proof of the Galois criterion follows the existing number-field analogue
`NumberField.ncard_primesOver_eq_finrank_iff_stabilizer_eq_bot` in
`TauCeti/NumberTheory/NumberField/SplitsCompletely/Basic.lean`. The non-Galois criterion is proved
directly from the function-field fundamental identity.
