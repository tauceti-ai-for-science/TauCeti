# The decomposition group and the decomposition field of a place

Let `F' / F` be a finite Galois extension of fields, `k` a subfield of `F`, and `P` a place of
`F' / k`.  The Galois group acts on the places of `F' / k` and is transitive on each fibre of
restriction, so the fibre through `P` is the orbit of `P` and the stabilizer of `P` — Mathlib's
`ValuationSubring.decompositionSubgroup` of the valuation ring of `P` — has index the number of
places over `P ∩ F`.  Comparing that count with the fundamental identity `r · e · f = [F' : F]`
gives the order of the decomposition group,
`TauCeti.Place.card_decompositionSubgroup`: it is `e(P ∣ P ∩ F) · f(P ∣ P ∩ F)`.

The **decomposition field** `Z` of `P` is the subfield of `F'` fixed by that group.  The Galois
group of `F'` over `Z` is again the decomposition group, so every automorphism of `F'` over `Z`
fixes `P`, and transitivity then forces `P` to be the *only* place of `F'` over its restriction
to `Z`.  With the
fibre a single point, the fundamental identity over the decomposition field reads
`e(P ∣ P ∩ Z) · f(P ∣ P ∩ Z) = [F' : Z] = e(P ∣ P ∩ F) · f(P ∣ P ∩ F)`, and multiplicativity in
the tower `F ⊆ Z ⊆ F'` then splits off `e = f = 1` below `Z`: the whole of the ramification and
of the residue extension of `P` over `F` happens over the decomposition field.

This is Stichtenoth, Definition 3.8.1 and the first half of Theorem 3.8.2.  The second half —
that the decomposition group surjects onto the automorphism group of the separable part of the
residue extension, with kernel the inertia group `ValuationSubring.inertiaSubgroup` — is not
proved here.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.Place.decompositionField`: the subfield of `F'` fixed by the decomposition group of a
  place, an `IntermediateField F F'`, with `TauCeti.Place.mem_decompositionField_iff` for its
  membership and `TauCeti.Place.fixingSubgroup_decompositionField` for the Galois correspondence
  it sits in: its fixing subgroup is the decomposition group again.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.Place.card_decompositionSubgroup`: the decomposition group of `P` has order
  `e(P ∣ P ∩ F) · f(P ∣ P ∩ F)`, and `TauCeti.Place.finrank_decompositionField` restates this as
  the degree of `F'` over the decomposition field.
* `TauCeti.Place.eq_of_restrict_decompositionField_eq` and
  `TauCeti.Place.setOf_restrict_decompositionField_eq_eq_singleton`: **a place is the only
  place of `F'` above its restriction to its decomposition field**.
* `TauCeti.Place.ramificationIdx_restrict_decompositionField` and
  `TauCeti.Place.relativeDegree_restrict_decompositionField`: below the decomposition field the
  ramification index and the relative degree are `1`, so by
  `TauCeti.Place.ramificationIdx_decompositionField` and
  `TauCeti.Place.relativeDegree_decompositionField` both are unchanged above it.
* `TauCeti.Place.decompositionSubgroup_decompositionField_eq_top`: over its decomposition field a
  place is fixed by the whole Galois group.
* `TauCeti.Place.decompositionSubgroup_integers_smul` and
  `TauCeti.Place.decompositionField_smul`: conjugate places have conjugate decomposition groups
  and decomposition fields.
* `TauCeti.Place.decompositionField_eq_top_iff_isSplitCompletely`: the decomposition field is
  everything exactly when the place below splits completely.
* `TauCeti.Place.ramificationIdx_mul_relativeDegree_restrict_eq_relIndex`: the local degree in
  an intermediate field is the index of its fixing subgroup in the decomposition group.
* `TauCeti.Place.isSplitCompletely_iff_forall_decompositionSubgroup_le`: complete splitting in
  an intermediate field is detected by all upstairs decomposition groups.
