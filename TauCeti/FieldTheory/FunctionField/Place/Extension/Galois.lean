# The Galois action on the places lying over a place

Let `F' / F` be an extension of fields and let `k` be a subfield of `F`. An `F`-automorphism `σ`
of `F'` transports the places of `F' / k`: the valuation `v_P ∘ σ⁻¹` is again normalized and
trivial on the constants, so `σ • P` is a place, and `v_{σ • P} (σ x) = v_P x`. Since `σ` fixes
`F` pointwise, `σ • P` lies over the same place of `F / k` as `P` does, with the same
ramification index and the same relative degree.

The main theorem is that when `F' / F` is a finite Galois extension this action is transitive on
each fibre: two places of `F' / k` lie over the same place of `F / k` exactly when one is carried
to the other by an automorphism (Stichtenoth, Theorem 3.7.1). The proof is the classical one:
weak approximation produces a function `z` with a zero at one of the two places and no zero or
pole anywhere on either orbit, and the norm `N_{F'/F} (z) = ∏ σ, σ z` — an element of `F` —
then has order `0` at one place of the fibre and order `> 0` at another, which is impossible
because on `F` the order at a place of `F'` is a positive multiple of the order at the place
below.

Consequently the ramification index and the relative degree are constant on a fibre, and the
fundamental identity of `TauCeti/FieldTheory/FunctionField/Place/Extension/Fundamental.lean` —
which applies because a Galois extension is separable — takes the product form
`r · e · f = [F' : F]` (Stichtenoth, Corollary 3.7.2). The stabilizer of a place is the
decomposition group, and is identified with Mathlib's `ValuationSubring.decompositionSubgroup`.

## Main definitions

* the `MulAction (F' ≃ₐ[F] F') (Place k F')` instance: the action of the automorphism group of
  `F' / F` on the places of `F' / k`, with `TauCeti.Place.valuation_smul` its defining property
  and `TauCeti.Place.integers_smul` the induced action on valuation rings.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.Place.restrictScalars_smul`: the automorphisms of `F'` over an intermediate field of
  `F' / F` act on the places of `F' / k` through the action of the automorphisms over `F`.
* `TauCeti.Place.valuation_apply_sub_lt_one_of_smul_eq_of_degree_eq_one`: an automorphism fixing
  a rational place has the same residue on every regular function at that place.
* `TauCeti.Place.degree_smul`: the action preserves the degree of a place over the constants.
* `TauCeti.Place.restrict_smul`, `TauCeti.Place.ramificationIdx_smul` and
  `TauCeti.Place.relativeDegree_smul`: the action preserves the fibres of
  `TauCeti.Place.restrict` and the two invariants attached to a place of a fibre.
* `TauCeti.Place.exists_smul_eq_of_restrict_eq` and the packaged
  `TauCeti.Place.restrict_eq_iff_exists_smul_eq`: **the Galois group acts transitively on the
  places over a place** (Stichtenoth, Theorem 3.7.1), with
  `TauCeti.Place.setOf_restrict_eq_eq_orbit` restating a fibre as an orbit.
* `TauCeti.Place.ramificationIdx_eq_of_restrict_eq` and
  `TauCeti.Place.relativeDegree_eq_of_restrict_eq`: `e` and `f` are constant on a fibre, whence
  `TauCeti.Place.ncard_mul_ramificationIdx_mul_relativeDegree_eq_finrank`, the product form
  `r · e · f = [F' : F]` of the fundamental identity (Stichtenoth, Corollary 3.7.2).
* `TauCeti.Place.ramificationIdxIn`: the common ramification index of the places over a place of
  `F`, zero exactly on an empty fibre (`TauCeti.Place.ramificationIdxIn_eq_zero_iff`) and positive
  for an extension of function fields (`TauCeti.Place.ramificationIdxIn_pos`), with
  `TauCeti.Place.ramificationIdxIn_mul_sum_fibre_eq` summing `e - 1` over a fibre:
  `∑_{P' ∣ P} (e(P' ∣ P) - 1) · deg P' = [F' : F] · (1 - 1/e) · deg P`, cleared of the division.
* `TauCeti.Place.stabilizer_eq_decompositionSubgroup`: the stabilizer of a place is the
  decomposition group of its valuation ring, and
  `TauCeti.Place.ncard_mul_card_stabilizer_eq_finrank` is the orbit--stabilizer count of a
  fibre.
