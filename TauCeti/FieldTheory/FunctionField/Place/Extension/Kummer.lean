# Kummer's theorem: places over a place, from a factorization modulo that place

Let `P` be a place of an algebraic function field `F / k`, let `F' / k'` be a finite extension of
`F / k`, and let `y : F'` be integral over the valuation ring `𝒪_P`, say `φ (y) = 0` for a monic
`φ ∈ 𝒪_P[X]` whose image in `F[X]` is the minimal polynomial of `y`.  Reducing `φ` modulo the
maximal ideal of `𝒪_P` gives a polynomial over the residue field `F_P`, and **each monic
irreducible factor `γ` of that reduction produces a place `P'` of `F' / k'` over `P`** at which
`γ (y)` vanishes and whose relative degree is at least `deg γ`; distinct factors produce distinct
places.  This is the unconditional half of Kummer's theorem, Stichtenoth, *Algebraic Function
Fields and Codes*, 2nd ed., Theorem 3.3.7.

The construction is direct.  A monic lift `g ∈ 𝒪_P[X]` of `γ` spans, together with the maximal
ideal of `𝒪_P`, an ideal of `𝒪_P[y]` whose quotient is `F_P[X] / (γ)`, a field; the ideal is
therefore proper, and it is nonzero because it contains a uniformizer of `P`.  Stichtenoth's
existence theorem for places dominates it by a place `P'` of `F'`.  The valuation ring of `P'`
then contains `𝒪_P`, so `P'` lies over `P`; and `g (y)` lies in the maximal ideal of `P'`, so the
residue of `y` is a root of `γ` in `F'_{P'}`.  Since `γ` is irreducible it is the minimal
polynomial of that residue over `F_P`, which both bounds the relative degree below by `deg γ` and
shows that `γ` is recovered from `P'` — whence the distinctness of the places attached to distinct
factors.

⚠ Kummer's theorem in this unconditional form **bounds** the splitting of `P` in `F'` but does not
determine it: the ramification indices are not computed and there may be places over `P` that no
factor of the reduction produces.  The complementary statement, that the places produced are all
of them with `e (P' ∣ P) = ε` the multiplicity of `γ` in the reduction and `f (P' ∣ P) = deg γ`,
needs the monogenicity hypothesis `𝒪'_P = 𝒪_P[y]` (Stichtenoth, Corollary 3.3.8) and is not proved
here.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.Place.integersEval`: evaluation at `y : F'` of a polynomial over the valuation ring
  `𝒪_P` of a place `P` of `F / k`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.Place.exists_monic_map_residue_eq`: monic polynomials over the residue field `F_P` lift
  to monic polynomials over `𝒪_P`.
* `TauCeti.Place.exists_restrict_eq_of_irreducible_map_residue`: **Kummer's theorem** for a single
  irreducible factor (Stichtenoth, Theorem 3.3.7).
* `TauCeti.Place.map_residue_eq_of_valuation_lt_one`: a place over `P` sees at most one
  irreducible factor, which is what makes the places of distinct factors distinct.
* `TauCeti.Place.exists_injective_restrict_eq`: **Kummer's theorem**, packaged: an injective
  family of places over `P`, indexed by a family of monic irreducible factors of the reduction of
  `φ`, whose relative degrees are at least the degrees of the factors.
* `TauCeti.Place.exists_finset_card_eq_forall_exists_restrict_eq_valuation_sub_lt_one`: over an
  algebraically closed `k`, a separable reduction of `φ` gives `deg φ` constants `a`, each with a
  place over `P` at which `y - a` vanishes.
