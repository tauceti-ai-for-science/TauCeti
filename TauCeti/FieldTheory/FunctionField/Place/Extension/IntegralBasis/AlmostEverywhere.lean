# Almost every place admits a prescribed integral basis

Let `F' / F` be a finite separable extension and fix an `F`-basis `b` of `F'`. This file proves
that `b` is an integral basis over the valuation ring of all but finitely many places of an
algebraic function field `F / k`. This is Stichtenoth, *Algebraic Function Fields and Codes*,
2nd ed., Theorem 3.3.6.

There are two finiteness steps. First, any fixed element of `F'` is integral over `𝒪_P` for all
but finitely many `P`: outside the poles of the finitely many coefficients of its minimal
polynomial over `F`, that polynomial is defined over `𝒪_P`. Second, apply this simultaneously to
the vectors of `b` and its trace-dual basis. If both bases are integral at `P`, the trace formula
for the coordinates in `b` shows that every integral element has integral coordinates;
integrality of the vectors of `b` proves the converse.

This theorem is the finiteness input for the different divisor: a single basis can be used to
compute the complementary module away from finitely many places.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.Place.finite_setOf_not_isIntegral`: an element integral over `F` is integral over the
  valuation rings of all but finitely many places.
* `TauCeti.Place.finite_setOf_not_exists_map_eq_minpoly_and_separable`: the minimal polynomial of
  a separable element is defined over `𝒪_P`, with separable reduction, at all but finitely many
  places.
* `TauCeti.Place.finite_setOf_not_isIntegralBasis`: every basis is an integral basis at all but
  finitely many places (Stichtenoth, Theorem 3.3.6).
