# Totally ramified places, and the Eisenstein criterion

Let `F' / k'` be a finite extension of the field extension `F / k`. A place `P'` of `F' / k'` is
**totally ramified** over `F` when its ramification index is as large as the fundamental
inequality allows, `e(P' ∣ P) = [F' : F]`. The inequality then forces the rest of the picture:
the relative degree is `1` and `P'` is the *only* place of `F'` lying over `P`, which is
Stichtenoth's Definition 3.1.13 read at `P`.

The criterion that produces totally ramified places is Eisenstein's. Call `φ ∈ F[X]`
*Eisenstein at a place `P` of `F / k`* when its leading coefficient is a unit of `𝒪_P`, every
coefficient below the leading one vanishes at `P`, and the constant coefficient vanishes to
order exactly one — the three conditions of Mathlib's `Polynomial.IsEisensteinAt` at the maximal
ideal of `𝒪_P`, read off the order function so that a polynomial over `F` may be tested. If `y`
generates `F'` over `F` and its minimal polynomial is Eisenstein at `P`, then every place `P'`
of `F'` over `P` is totally ramified and `y` is a prime element at `P'`.

The proof is the Newton-polygon computation, run with the strict triangle inequality. Write
`n = deg φ`, `e = e(P' ∣ P)` and `m = ord_{P'} y`, and expand `0 = φ(y)` as the sum of its
`n + 1` terms. The term of index `i < n` has order at least `e + i·m` because its coefficient
vanishes at `P`, the term of index `0` has order exactly `e`, and the leading term has order
`n·m`. If any one of the terms had order strictly smaller than all the others, the strict
triangle inequality would make the sum nonzero; so neither the leading term nor the constant
term can dominate, and comparing the two possibilities gives `n·m = e` — first for `m ≤ 0`,
where the leading term would dominate, and then for the two ways `n·m` and `e` could differ.
Since `e ≤ [F' : F] = n` and `m ≥ 1`, this forces `e = n` and `m = 1`.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.Place.IsTotallyRamified`: `e(P' ∣ P) = [F' : F]` (Stichtenoth, Definition 3.1.13).
* `TauCeti.Place.IsEisensteinAt`: a polynomial over `F` is Eisenstein at a place of `F / k`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.Place.relativeDegree_eq_one_of_isTotallyRamified` and
  `TauCeti.Place.eq_of_isTotallyRamified`: a totally ramified place has relative degree `1` and
  is the only place lying over the place below it, packaged as
  `TauCeti.Place.setOf_restrict_eq_eq_singleton_of_isTotallyRamified`.
* `TauCeti.Place.adjoin_eq_top_of_isTotallyRamified_of_ord_eq_one`: every uniformizer at a
  totally ramified place generates the field extension.
* `TauCeti.Place.IsEisensteinAt.natDegree_pos`: an Eisenstein polynomial has positive degree.
* `TauCeti.Place.natDegree_mul_ord_eq_ramificationIdx`: the order of a root of an Eisenstein
  polynomial, `n · ord_{P'} y = e(P' ∣ P)`.
* `TauCeti.Place.isTotallyRamified_of_isEisensteinAt` and
  `TauCeti.Place.ord_eq_one_of_isEisensteinAt`: **the Eisenstein criterion** (Stichtenoth,
  Proposition 3.1.15).
* `TauCeti.Place.isEisensteinAt_map`: a polynomial over `𝒪_P` that is Eisenstein at the maximal
  ideal of `𝒪_P` in the sense of Mathlib's `Polynomial.IsEisensteinAt` is Eisenstein at `P` in
  the sense used here.

/-- A polynomial over `F` is **Eisenstein at a place `P` of `F / k`** when its leading
coefficient is a unit of `𝒪_P`, every coefficient below the leading one vanishes at `P`, and the
constant coefficient vanishes to order exactly one. For a polynomial with coefficients in `𝒪_P`
these are the three conditions of Mathlib's `Polynomial.IsEisensteinAt` at the maximal ideal of
`𝒪_P`; see `TauCeti.Place.isEisensteinAt_map`. The conditions are stated through the valuation
and the order function rather than through membership in the maximal ideal, so that a polynomial
over `F` — for instance a minimal polynomial — may be tested directly; the junk value
`ord_P 0 = 0` is avoided by using the valuation in the condition that admits zero coefficients. -/

/-- **The Eisenstein criterion** (Stichtenoth, Proposition 3.1.15): if `F' = F(y)` and the
minimal polynomial of `y` over `F` is Eisenstein at the place of `F / k` below `P'`, then `P'`
is totally ramified over `F`. Together with
`TauCeti.Place.setOf_restrict_eq_eq_singleton_of_isTotallyRamified` this says that the place
below `P'` is totally ramified in `F' / F`: it has exactly one extension, of ramification index
`[F' : F]` and relative degree `1`. -/

    (htop : IntermediateField.adjoin F {y} = ⊤)
    (hφ : (P'.restrict k F).IsEisensteinAt (minpoly F y)) :
    IsTotallyRamified F P' :=
  (ramificationIdx_eq_and_ord_eq_one k F htop hφ).1
