# Existence of places of an algebraic function field

Stichtenoth's existence theorem (Theorem 1.1.19) produces a place out of nothing but a subring and
a proper nonzero ideal: if `k ⊆ R ⊆ F` and `I` is a proper nonzero ideal of `R`, then some place
`P` of `F / k` has `R ⊆ 𝒪_P` and `I ⊆ 𝔪_P`. Its consequence (Corollary 1.1.20) is the statement
that gives the divisor theory its substance: every element of `F` transcendental over `k` has both
a zero and a pole, so `ℙ_F` is nonempty and the constants `algebraicClosure k F` are exactly the
functions regular at every place.

Combined with weak approximation, the existence of poles shows that there are infinitely many
places (Stichtenoth, Corollary 1.3.2): at finitely many places a single function could be given a
zero everywhere, and such a function would be transcendental yet have no pole.

The Zorn's lemma half of Theorem 1.1.19 is Mathlib's
`Ideal.image_subset_nonunits_valuationSubring`, which dominates a proper ideal of a subring of a
field by a valuation subring. What is specific to function fields is that the resulting valuation
subring is discrete, and that is
`TauCeti.Place.ofValuationSubring`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.Place.exists_ord_pos` and `TauCeti.Place.exists_ord_neg`: an element transcendental over
  the constants has a zero and a pole (Stichtenoth, Corollary 1.1.20).
* `TauCeti.Place.nonempty`: an algebraic function field has at least one place.
* `TauCeti.Place.infinite`: an algebraic function field has infinitely many places.
* `TauCeti.Place.infinite_setOf_degree_eq_one`: over an algebraically closed field there are
  infinitely many rational places.

  `TauCeti.Place.coe_algebraicClosure_eq_iInter_integers`: `algebraicClosure k F = ⋂_P 𝒪_P`, the
  constants are the everywhere-regular functions.
* `TauCeti.Place.exists_algebraMap_notMem_integers`: every subring with fraction field `F` has a
  place at infinity.

/-! ### The existence theorem -/

/-- **Stichtenoth, Theorem 1.1.19.** Let `R` be a subring of `F` containing the constants and let
`I` be a proper nonzero ideal of `R`. Then some place of `F / k` has `R` inside its valuation ring
and `I` inside its maximal ideal.

Mathlib's `Ideal.image_subset_nonunits_valuationSubring` supplies a valuation subring `B` of `F`
with `R ≤ B` and `I` inside the nonunits of `B`; because `I` is nonzero, `B` is a *proper*
valuation subring, so `TauCeti.Place.ofValuationSubring` turns it into a place. -/

were infinite on `R`, every element of `R` would be regular at every place, hence algebraic over
`k` (`TauCeti.Place.mem_algebraicClosure_iff_forall_mem_integers`); the algebraic elements form a
subfield, so every fraction of two elements of `R` would be algebraic too, and `F` is the fraction
field of `R`. That contradicts the transcendental element of an algebraic function field. -/
