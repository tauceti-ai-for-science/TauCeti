# Nonspecial divisors of degree `g` on prescribed rational places

A divisor `B` of a function field `F / k` of genus `g` is *nonspecial* when its index of
specialty `i(B) = ℓ(B) - deg B - 1 + g` vanishes.  Every divisor of degree at least `2g - 1` is
nonspecial, and an effective nonspecial divisor has degree at least `g`.  This file shows that
this smallest degree is attained on any prescribed set of at least `g` rational places:

if `T` is a set of places of degree one with at least `g` elements, then some effective divisor
`B` with support in `T` has `deg B = g` and `ℓ(B) = 1`, equivalently `i(B) = 0`.

This is Stichtenoth, *Algebraic Function Fields and Codes*, 2nd ed., Proposition 1.6.12, over an
arbitrary exact constant field.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.Divisor.exists_degree_eq_genus_dim_eq_one`: **nonspecial divisors of degree `g`**
  supported on any prescribed set of at least `g` rational places (Stichtenoth,
  Proposition 1.6.12).
* `TauCeti.Divisor.exists_mem_riemannRochSpace_add_ofPoint_ord_neg`: for an effective `B` with
  `deg B = g` and `ℓ(B) = 1`, and a rational place `Q`, some function of `L(B + Q)` has a pole
  at `Q`.
