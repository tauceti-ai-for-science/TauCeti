# Galois orbits on the roots of a polynomial

Let `p` be a polynomial over a field `F` and let `E` be an extension in which `p` splits. The
Galois group `Polynomial.Gal p` acts on `p.rootSet E`, and this file identifies the orbits of
that action with the monic irreducible factors of `p`.

The invariant that separates the orbits is the minimal polynomial: two roots lie in the same
orbit exactly when they have the same minimal polynomial over `F`, so the orbit of a root is the
whole root set of its minimal polynomial. When `p` is nonzero, passing to the orbit quotient
turns this into a bijection with the distinct monic irreducible factors of `p`, that is, with
the members of `Polynomial.Factors p`.

The dictionary also identifies transitivity of the root action with irreducibility for a
separable polynomial of positive degree, together with its relative form: inside a normal
extension, irreducibility over an intermediate field is transitivity of the subgroup fixing that
field. It records the same descriptions for the action inside the splitting field itself, where an
irreducible polynomial acts transitively.

For the intrinsic action, this file also records the evaluation rule on the splitting field and
the instances identifying `Polynomial.Gal p` as a Galois group for that field over the base.

## Main results

* `Polynomial.Gal.galActionHom_eq_permCongr`: the root permutations in two splitting extensions
  correspond under `Polynomial.Gal.rootsEquivRoots`.
* `TauCeti.mem_orbit_iff_minpoly_eq`: two roots of `p` are in the same Galois orbit exactly when
  their minimal polynomials agree.
* `TauCeti.image_val_orbit_eq_rootSet_minpoly`: read inside `E`, the orbit of a root is the root
  set of its minimal polynomial.
* `TauCeti.natCard_orbit_eq_natDegree_minpoly`: when the corresponding minimal polynomial is
  separable, an orbit has as many elements as its degree.
* `TauCeti.isPretransitive_iff_irreducible`: for separable `p` of positive degree, transitivity
  of the root action is equivalent to irreducibility of `p`.
* `TauCeti.isPretransitive_range_galActionHom`: the Galois image of an irreducible polynomial,
  as a group of permutations of the roots, is transitive.
* `TauCeti.isPretransitive_gal_rootSet_of_isPretransitive_algEquiv`: in any splitting extension
  `E`, if the automorphism group `Gal(E/F)` is transitive on the roots, then so is `p.Gal`.
* `TauCeti.isPretransitive_algEquiv_rootSet_iff_gal`: in a normal splitting extension `E`, the
  automorphism group `Gal(E/F)` is transitive on the roots exactly when `p.Gal` is.
* `TauCeti.irreducible_map_iff_isPretransitive_fixingSubgroup`: in a normal splitting extension
  `E`, a separable `p` stays irreducible over an intermediate field `K` exactly when the
  automorphisms fixing `K` act transitively on the roots.
* `TauCeti.mem_orbit_iff_minpoly_eq_splittingField`,
  `TauCeti.image_val_orbit_eq_rootSet_minpoly_splittingField`,
  `TauCeti.natCard_orbit_eq_natDegree_minpoly_splittingField`: the same three descriptions of an
  orbit for the intrinsic action on the roots in the splitting field.
* `Polynomial.Gal.galActionAux_isPretransitive`: inside the splitting field, an irreducible
  polynomial has a transitive root action.
* `Polynomial.Gal.galActionAux_isPretransitive_of_dvd_pow`: the same for every divisor of a
  power of an irreducible polynomial, separable or not.
* `Polynomial.Gal.smul_eq_apply`: the action on the splitting field is evaluation.
* `TauCeti.galIsGaloisGroup`: `Polynomial.Gal p` is a Galois group for its splitting field.
* `TauCeti.orbitQuotientEquivFactors`: the orbit quotient is in bijection with the
  monic irreducible factors of `p`, the orbit of a root going to its minimal polynomial.
* `TauCeti.natCard_orbit_eq_natDegree_factor`: along that bijection, a separable
  factor has as many roots in the matching orbit as its degree.

Galois group acts transitively on its two distinct roots
(`TauCeti.isPretransitive_gal_X_sq_sub_two_sq`). Without separability the forward
implication only says that `p` is a unit times a power of one irreducible polynomial. -/

Normality cannot be dropped: for `p = X ^ 2 - 2` over `ℚ` and `E = ℚ(α)` with `α` the real fourth

/-! ## The action inside the splitting field -/

/- The results below are about `p.rootSet p.SplittingField` carrying Mathlib's
`Polynomial.Gal.galActionAux`, the intrinsic action for which `↑(g • x)` is literally `g ↑x`.
That is not the instance `E := p.SplittingField` gives the results above: those use
`Polynomial.Gal.galAction`, the transport of `galActionAux` along `Gal.rootsEquivRoots`, which
goes through the `Algebra p.SplittingField p.SplittingField` instance built from
`IsSplittingField.lift` rather than through the identity. So no `Fact` instance is introduced
here; the orbit descriptions are obtained by feeding the intrinsic orbit criterion to the same
proofs as above, and transitivity is proved directly rather than read off
`TauCeti.isPretransitive_iff_irreducible` or `Polynomial.Gal.galAction_isPretransitive`. -/
