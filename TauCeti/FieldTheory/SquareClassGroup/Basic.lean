# The square-class group `Kˣ ⧸ (Kˣ)²`

For a field `K`, the **square-class group** is the quotient of `Kˣ` by its squares. Every element
has order dividing `2`, so the quotient is an `𝔽₂ = ZMod 2`-vector space (Mathlib's
`QuotientAddGroup.zmodModule`, written additively on `Additive Kˣ`).

A `ZMod 2`-linear combination of the classes of a finite family of units is, up to the `{0, 1}`
coefficients, exactly a subset product, and it vanishes precisely when that subset product is a
square. So linear independence of the classes is the **Finset form** of square-class independence
(no nonempty subset product is a square), one subset at a time.

## Main definitions and results

* `TauCeti.SquareClassGroup`: the square-class group `Kˣ ⧸ (Kˣ)²`, an `𝔽₂`-vector space.
* `TauCeti.squareClass`, `TauCeti.squareClassHom`: the class of a unit, as a function and a
  multiplicative homomorphism, with `squareClass_eq_zero_iff` characterising the trivial class as
  the squares, `ker_squareClassHom` identifying the kernel of the quotient map with the subgroup
  of squares, and `squareClass_mul`, `squareClass_prod`, `squareClass_pow`, `squareClass_zpow`
  computing it on products and powers.
* `TauCeti.squareClass_eq_iff_isSquare_mul`: equality of square classes read as a square product.
* `TauCeti.SquareClassGroup.two_nsmul_eq_zero`: the square-class group is killed by two.
* `TauCeti.linearIndependent_squareClass_iff`: the classes of `d : ι → Kˣ` are `ZMod 2`-linearly
  independent iff no nonempty subset product is a square.
