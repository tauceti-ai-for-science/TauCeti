# Embedding a purely inseparable extension into a field with enough roots

Let `M / K` be a purely inseparable extension of exponent at most `n`, so that
`x ↦ x ^ (p ^ n)` is a ring homomorphism `M →+* K` (`IsPurelyInseparable.iterateFrobenius`). If a
field `K'` over `K` contains `p ^ n`-th roots of the images of a generating set of `M`, then `M`
embeds into `K'` over `K`: the embedding is `ψ⁻¹ ∘ φ` for `φ` the Frobenius of `M` into `K` and
`ψ` the (injective) Frobenius of `K'`. Mathlib provides this embedding only into perfect fields
(`IsPurelyInseparable.instNonemptyAlgHomOfPerfectField`); the target that
normalization-finiteness needs, `k'(X_1, …, X_r)`, is not perfect.

The companion existence statement — for finitely many elements of a field, a finite extension
containing `n`-th roots of all of them — is
`TauCeti.exists_finiteDimensional_forall_exists_pow_eq`, in
`TauCeti/FieldTheory/IntermediateField/Adjoin/Roots.lean`; nothing about it is specific to purely
inseparable extensions.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.IsPurelyInseparable.nonempty_algHom_of_forall_exists_pow_eq`: the embedding of a
  purely inseparable extension of bounded exponent into any field over `K` containing
  `p ^ n`-th roots of the Frobenius images of a generating set.

## Provenance

The mathematics is the field-theoretic half of the "some details omitted" sentence of Stacks
10.161.13 (tag 032O): there is a finite purely inseparable `L' / K` and `q = p ^ e` with
`L ⊂ L'(x^{1/q})`.

/-- Source: Stacks, Lemma 10.161.13 (tag 032O), proof: "`L ⊂ L′(x^{1/q})`; some details omitted"
— the embedding. Let `M / K` be purely inseparable of exponent at most `n`, with Frobenius
`φ = IsPurelyInseparable.iterateFrobenius K M p hn : M →+* K`, and let `s` generate `M` over
`K`. If every `φ x` for `x ∈ s` has a `p ^ n`-th root in a field `K'` over `K`, then `M` embeds
into `K'` over `K`. -/
