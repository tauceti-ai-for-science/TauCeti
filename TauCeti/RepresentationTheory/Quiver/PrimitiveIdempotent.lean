# The vertex idempotents of a path algebra are primitive

Let `Q` be a quiver with finitely many vertices and `k` a semiring in which `1` is a primitive
idempotent — a domain or a local ring, say (`TauCeti.isPrimitiveIdempotent_one`). Then every
vertex idempotent `eᵥ` of the path algebra `kQ` is primitive: it is not the sum of two nonzero
orthogonal idempotents. Read through
`TauCeti.isPrimitiveIdempotent_iff_isIndecomposableModule`, this says that the left ideal
`kQ eᵥ` — the indecomposable projective `Pᵥ` — is an indecomposable module, and it is the input to
the primitive-idempotent decomposition of `1 = ∑ᵥ eᵥ`
(`TauCeti.PathAlgebra.completeOrthogonalIdempotents_vertexIdempotent`).

No hypothesis is placed on the paths at `v`: oriented cycles through `v` are allowed. For the
quiver with a single vertex and a single loop at it, where `kQ` is the polynomial ring `k[X]`
(`TauCeti.PathAlgebra.oneLoopAlgEquiv`) and the one vertex idempotent is `1`, the statement is that
`1` is primitive in `k[X]`. Over a coefficient *ring*, where every idempotent has a complement,
that in turn says that `k[X]` has no idempotent other than `0` and `1`
(`TauCeti.isPrimitiveIdempotent_one_iff`); over a semiring it is the weaker statement that `1`
admits no splitting into two nonzero orthogonal idempotents.

What replaces that hypothesis is the length filtration of the path algebra (`TauCeti.pathSpan`),
which is where the two coordinate facts this file rests on come from. Reading the coordinate on the
trivial path at `v` is a multiplicative map `kQ → k` (`TauCeti.pathAlgebraBasis_repr_mul_nil`),
because a concatenation is that trivial path only when both its factors are; and the arrow ideal —
the first step of the filtration, the elements whose coordinates on the trivial paths all vanish —
contains no nonzero idempotent
(`TauCeti.eq_zero_of_isIdempotentElem_of_mem_pathSpan_one`). Among the trivial paths, only the one
at `v` can carry a nonzero coordinate of an element of the corner `eᵥ kQ eᵥ`, a vertex idempotent
on the left confining the coordinates to the paths ending at `v`
(`TauCeti.pathAlgebraBasis_repr_vertexIdempotent_mul`). So the trivial-path coordinates of
the two summands of a decomposition of `eᵥ` decompose `1` in `k`, and the summand whose coordinate
primitivity of `1` kills lies in the arrow ideal, hence is zero.

The acyclic-at-`v` form of the theorem instead computed the corner `eᵥ kQ eᵥ` outright as a copy of
`k` (`TauCeti.vertexIdempotent_mul_mul_vertexIdempotent`), which is where the path hypothesis was
needed; that computation plays no part here.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.isPrimitiveIdempotent_vertexIdempotent`: **a vertex idempotent of the path algebra of a
  quiver with finitely many vertices is primitive** as soon as `1` is primitive in the coefficient
  semiring.
* `TauCeti.isIndecomposableModule_span_singleton_vertexIdempotent`: consequently the left ideal
  `kQ eᵥ` is an indecomposable `kQ`-module.

Primitivity of `eᵥ` is a semiring-level statement. Additive inverses enter only with the corollary,
the module characterization asking for a ring.

## References

This supplies the vertex-idempotent instance of the primitive idempotents of Layer 3A in
`TauCetiRoadmap/RepresentationTheory/QuiverRepresentations/README.md`, whose Layer 1 identifies
`kQ eᵥ` with the indecomposable projective `Pᵥ`.
