# The path algebra inside the preprojective algebra

Let `Q` be a finite quiver. Its path algebra `kQ` maps to the additive preprojective algebra
`Π_k(Q)`, by including `Q` in the doubled quiver `Quiver.Symmetrify Q` and passing to the quotient.
In the other direction, killing every formal reverse `a*` is an algebra homomorphism from the
doubled path algebra onto `kQ` which kills both backtracks `a a*` and `a* a` of every arrow, hence
the preprojective relator; so it descends to

```text
Π_k(Q) → kQ,
```

and this is a retraction of the first map. Thus `kQ` is simultaneously a subalgebra and a quotient
algebra of `Π_k(Q)`.

The quotient statement bounds `Π_k(Q)` from below: if `Π_k(Q)` is a finite module over a nonzero
commutative ring then so is `kQ`, and `Q` has no oriented cycle. Since `Π_k(Q)` does not depend on
the orientation of `Q` (`TauCeti.reorientPreprojectiveAlgebraEquiv`), the same holds for every
reorientation `TauCeti.Reorient Q σ` of `Q`. A cycle of the underlying multigraph of `Q` — a loop,
a pair of parallel arrows, or a cycle through distinct vertices — becomes an oriented cycle after
turning some of its arrows around. Consequently the preprojective algebra of a quiver whose
underlying graph is not a forest is not a finite module; this includes every quiver of affine type
`Ã_n`.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.pathAlgebraToPreprojective`: the algebra homomorphism `kQ →ₐ[k] Π_k(Q)`.
* `TauCeti.preprojectiveToPathAlgebra`: the algebra homomorphism `Π_k(Q) →ₐ[k] kQ` killing the
  formal reverses.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.preprojectiveToPathAlgebra_comp_pathAlgebraToPreprojective`: **the second is a
  retraction of the first**, so that `TauCeti.pathAlgebraToPreprojective_injective` and
  `TauCeti.preprojectiveToPathAlgebra_surjective` hold.
* `TauCeti.isAcyclic_of_module_finite_preprojectiveAlgebra`: a quiver whose preprojective algebra is
  a finite module has no oriented cycle.
* `TauCeti.isAcyclic_reorient_of_module_finite_preprojectiveAlgebra`: **no reorientation of such a
  quiver has an oriented cycle**, and `TauCeti.not_module_finite_preprojectiveAlgebra_of_length_pos`
  is the same statement read from a cycle of a reorientation.

## References

The inclusion of `kQ` in `Π_k(Q)` and the quotient map killing the reverse arrows are standard; see

algebra of a quiver*, in *Algebras and Modules II*, CMS Conf. Proc. 24 (1998).
