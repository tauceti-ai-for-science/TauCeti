# Path reduction in the type-`D` preprojective algebra

In the Bourbaki labelling of `Dₙ` (`n ≥ 3`), write `c = n - 3`. The nodes `0 — 1 — ⋯ — c` form
the long arm, and the two leaves `c + 1` and `c + 2` are attached to the branch node `c`. In the
signless algebra `TauCeti.signlessPreprojectiveAlgebra` of the doubled graph write

* `x` and `y` for the backtracks `c → c + 1 → c` and `c → c + 2 → c`, and
* `q` for the backtrack `c → c - 1 → c` into the long arm.

The relation at a leaf says that the backtrack from the leaf vanishes, so `x * x = 0` and
`y * y = 0`, and the relation at the branch node says `x + y + q = 0`. Along the long arm, read
from the branch node, the relations are the ladder relations of
`TauCeti.Algebra.Ring.LadderValley` at every rung except the bottom one, and the ladder has only
`c` rungs; hence `q ^ (c + 1) = 0` (`TauCeti.pow_d_mul_u_eq_zero`). So `(x + y) ^ (c + 1) = 0`,
and every product of `c + 2` factors from `{x, y}` vanishes (`TauCeti.span_pair_pow_succ_eq_bot`).

A path is then rewritten, one arrow at a time, into one of the following normal forms: a valley
word on the long arm which does not reach the branch node; or a word of the shape
`(path out of c) · w · (path into c)`, where `w` lies in a power of the span of `{x, y}` and the
outer paths are the direct paths into and out of the branch node, with the entry allowed an
integer scalar, and have length at most `c + 1`. A long enough path has `w` in a power of degree
at least `c + 2`, so **every path of length at least `4 n` vanishes**. Below rank three the diagram
has no edges, and the same bound holds trivially. The bound `4 n` is not sharp; the sharp bound
`h - 1`, for the Coxeter number `h = 2 n - 2` of `Dₙ`, is not proved here.

The signless algebra of a bipartite graph is the preprojective algebra of each of its
orientations, by an explicit sign rescaling of the arrows. Thus the same bound holds in the
preprojective algebra `Π_k(Q)` of every orientation `Q` of `Dₙ`, over every commutative ring; the
relation ideal is admissible, and `Π_k(Q)` is finite-dimensional over every field.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.signlessPreprojectiveMk_D_ofPath_eq_zero_of_le`: paths of length at least `4 n` vanish
  in the signless algebra of `Dₙ`.
* `TauCeti.preprojectiveMk_D_ofPath_eq_zero_of_le`: the same in the preprojective algebra of every
  orientation of `Dₙ`.
* `TauCeti.isAdmissibleIdeal_preprojectiveIdeal_D`: the preprojective relation ideal of every
  orientation of `Dₙ` is admissible.
* `TauCeti.instFiniteDimensionalPreprojectiveAlgebraD` and
  `TauCeti.instFiniteDimensionalSignlessPreprojectiveAlgebraD`: the preprojective algebra of
  every orientation of `Dₙ`, and the signless algebra of `Dₙ`, are finite-dimensional.
