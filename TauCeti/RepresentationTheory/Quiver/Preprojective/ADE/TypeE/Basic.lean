# The preprojective algebras of `E₆`, `E₇`, and `E₈` are finite-dimensional

In the Bourbaki labelling of `Eₙ` (`n ≥ 4`, Mathlib's `CartanMatrix.E n`), the node `3` is the
branch node, and three arms leave it: the leaf `1`; the arm `2, 0`; and the long arm
`4, 5, …, n - 1`. Read each arm as a ladder whose rung `0` is the branch node, so that its rung
`r` is the node at distance `r` from the branch node. In the signless algebra
`TauCeti.signlessPreprojectiveAlgebra` of the doubled graph, the relation at each node of an arm
says that the two backtracks there cancel: these are the ladder relations of
`TauCeti.Algebra.Ring.LadderValley` at every rung except the bottom one. Write

* `x`, `y` and `z` for the backtracks from the branch node into the leaf, into the arm `2, 0` and
  into the long arm.

A ladder with `N` rungs above the bottom one has nilpotent bottom turn
(`TauCeti.pow_d_mul_u_eq_zero`), so `x ^ 2 = 0`, `y ^ 3 = 0` and `z ^ (n - 3) = 0`, and the
relation at the branch node is `x + y + z = 0`.

A path is rewritten, one arrow at a time, into one of two normal forms: a valley word on one
arm which does not reach the branch node; or a word of the shape
`(climb out of the branch node) · w · (path into the branch node)`, where `w` is a product of
backtracks at the branch node, and so lies in a power of the span of `x` and `y`. Every
backtrack added to `w` adds two to the length of the path, while the outer paths have length less
than `n`. Hence if the `M`-th power of the span of `x` and `y` vanishes, every path of length at
least `2 n + 2 M` vanishes.

For `E₆` the long arm has two nodes, so `(x + y) ^ 3 = (-z) ^ 3 = 0`, and every product of six
factors from `{x, y}` vanishes (`TauCeti.span_pair_pow_six_eq_bot`). Hence **every path of
length at least `24` vanishes** in the signless algebra of `E₆`. The bound `24` is not sharp; the
sharp bound `h - 1 = 11`, for the Coxeter number `h = 12` of `E₆`, is not proved here.

For `E₈` the long arm has four nodes, so `(x + y) ^ 5 = (-z) ^ 5 = 0`, and every product of
fifteen factors from `{x, y}` vanishes (`TauCeti.span_pair_pow_fifteen_eq_bot`). Hence **every
path of length at least `46` vanishes** in the signless algebra of `E₈`. Again the bound is not
sharp: the sharp bound is `h - 1 = 29`, for the Coxeter number `h = 30` of `E₈`. The `E₈`
results are stated for the named Bourbaki-labelled graph `TauCeti.zigzagE8Graph`.

For `E₇`, the Bourbaki-labelled inclusion into `E₈`, recorded in
`TauCeti.DynkinType.cartanMatrix_E7_eq_submatrix_E8`, identifies its signless algebra with an
induced subgraph quotient. This transfers finite dimensionality from `E₈` to `E₇`. The signless
`E₇` instance retains the caller's neighborhood `Fintype` instances as parameters, so its
conclusion refers to the quotient carrier formed with those enumerations.

The signless algebra of a bipartite graph is the preprojective algebra of each of its
orientations, by an explicit sign rescaling of the arrows. Thus the same bound holds in the
preprojective algebra `Π_k(Q)` of every orientation `Q` of `E₆` or `E₈`, over every commutative
ring; the relation ideal is admissible, and `Π_k(Q)` is finite-dimensional over every field.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.signlessPreprojectiveMk_E6_ofPath_eq_zero_of_le`: paths of length at least `24` vanish
  in the signless algebra of `E₆`.
* `TauCeti.preprojectiveMk_E6_ofPath_eq_zero_of_le`: the same in the preprojective algebra of
  every orientation of `E₆`.
* `TauCeti.isAdmissibleIdeal_preprojectiveIdeal_E6`: the preprojective relation ideal of every
  orientation of `E₆` is admissible.
* `TauCeti.instFiniteDimensionalPreprojectiveAlgebraE6` and
  `TauCeti.instFiniteDimensionalSignlessPreprojectiveAlgebraE6`: the preprojective algebra of
  every orientation of `E₆`, and the signless algebra of `E₆`, are finite-dimensional.
* `TauCeti.signlessPreprojectiveMk_E8_ofPath_eq_zero_of_le`,
  `TauCeti.preprojectiveMk_E8_ofPath_eq_zero_of_le`,
  `TauCeti.isAdmissibleIdeal_preprojectiveIdeal_E8`,
  `TauCeti.instFiniteDimensionalPreprojectiveAlgebraE8` and
  `TauCeti.instFiniteDimensionalSignlessPreprojectiveAlgebraE8`: the same for `E₈`, with the
  bound `46`.
* `TauCeti.instFiniteDimensionalPreprojectiveAlgebraE7` and
  `TauCeti.instFiniteDimensionalSignlessPreprojectiveAlgebraE7`: the preprojective algebra of
  every orientation of `E₇`, and the signless algebra of `E₇`, are finite-dimensional.
