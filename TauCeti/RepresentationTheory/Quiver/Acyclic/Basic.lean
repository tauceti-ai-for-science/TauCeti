# Acyclic quivers

This file defines an acyclic quiver to be one whose closed paths are all trivial. It develops
the elementary path API for excluding directed cycles, including the fact that paths cannot run
in both directions between distinct vertices.

This is the orientation-sensitive notion of acyclicity used for path algebras and quiver
representations. It is distinct from acyclicity of the underlying undirected graph.

This file implements the Layer 0 “Acyclicity, as a predicate” target of
`TauCetiRoadmap/RepresentationTheory/QuiverRepresentations/Suggested.lean` and its
