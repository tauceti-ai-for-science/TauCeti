# The module over the path algebra carried by a representation of a quiver

`TauCeti.RepresentationTheory.Quiver.Representation.OfModule` turns a left module over the path
algebra `kQ` of a finite quiver into a representation of `Q`, and proves that functor **fully
faithful**.  This file supplies the other half: the `kQ`-module `TauCeti.QuiverRep.asModule`
carried by a representation, the identification of its vertex components with the vertex spaces of
the representation one started from, and hence the **essential surjectivity** that completes the
equivalence

`TauCeti.quiverRepEquivalence : QuiverRep k Q ≌ ModuleCat (pathAlgebra k Q)`.

## The construction

The carrier is the direct sum `⨁ᵥ Mᵥ` of the vertex spaces.  A basis path `p : a ⟶ b` of `kQ` acts
on it by the endomorphism `TauCeti.QuiverRep.pathEnd` that reads off the `a`-component, applies the
structure map `M.map p`, and puts the result in the `b`-component; two such endomorphisms compose
to the endomorphism of the concatenated path when the paths meet
(`TauCeti.QuiverRep.pathEnd_mul_pathEnd_of_comp`) and to zero when they do not
(`TauCeti.QuiverRep.pathEnd_mul_pathEnd_of_not_composable`), while the trivial paths give the
component projections, which sum to the identity (`TauCeti.QuiverRep.sum_pathEnd_nil`).  Those are
exactly the three hypotheses of the universal property `TauCeti.PathAlgebra.liftAlgHom`, so the
assignment extends to an algebra homomorphism
`TauCeti.QuiverRep.toEnd : kQ →ₐ[k] End_k (⨁ᵥ Mᵥ)`, and `TauCeti.QuiverRep.asModule` is `⨁ᵥ Mᵥ`
with the module structure it induces.

With that in hand the vertex idempotent `eᵥ` acts as the composite of the projection to `Mᵥ` and
the inclusion back (`TauCeti.QuiverRep.vertexIdempotent_smul`), so the vertex component
`eᵥ · asModule` is exactly the image of `Mᵥ` (`TauCeti.QuiverRep.vertexComponent_asModule`) and the
inclusion is a `k`-linear isomorphism onto it, `TauCeti.QuiverRep.vertexComponentEquiv`.  Those
isomorphisms are natural in the path, because a path acts on the image of `Mₐ` through `M.map p`
(`TauCeti.QuiverRep.smul_ofVertex`, whence
`TauCeti.QuiverRep.pathMap_vertexComponentEquiv`); assembling them with
`CategoryTheory.NatIso.ofComponents` gives the natural isomorphism
`TauCeti.QuiverRep.asModuleIso`.  Transported to the model
`TauCeti.QuiverRep.asModuleShrink` of the carrier in the universe of the representation itself,
that isomorphism becomes `TauCeti.QuiverRep.asModuleShrinkIso`, the essential surjectivity of
`TauCeti.quiverRepFunctor`.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.QuiverRep.pathEnd`: the endomorphism of `⨁ᵥ Mᵥ` by which a basis path of `kQ` acts, and
  `TauCeti.QuiverRep.toEnd`: that action extended along the path basis as a `k`-algebra
  homomorphism into `End_k (⨁ᵥ Mᵥ)`.
* `TauCeti.QuiverRep.asModule`: **the `kQ`-module carried by a representation of `Q`**, the direct
  sum `⨁ᵥ Mᵥ` with the action of `TauCeti.QuiverRep.toEnd`.
* `TauCeti.QuiverRep.ofVertex` and `TauCeti.QuiverRep.toVertex`: the inclusion of a vertex space
  into that module and the projection onto it.
* `TauCeti.QuiverRep.asModuleShrink`: the model of that module in the universe of the
  representation, `TauCeti.QuiverRep.asModuleShrinkEquiv` identifying the two.
* `TauCeti.quiverRepEquivalence`: **representations of a quiver are modules over its path
  algebra**, with `TauCeti.quiverRepEquivalenceFunctorObjShrinkIso` identifying the module it sends
  a representation to with `TauCeti.QuiverRep.asModuleShrink`, and
  `TauCeti.quiverRepEquivalenceFunctorObjIso` identifying it with `TauCeti.QuiverRep.asModule`
  itself in the universe where the direct sum lives.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.QuiverRep.smul_ofPath`: a basis path acts on `asModule` by reading off the component at
  its source, applying the structure map and putting the result in the component at its target;
  the two cases used below are `TauCeti.QuiverRep.smul_ofVertex` and
  `TauCeti.QuiverRep.vertexIdempotent_smul`, the latter saying that the vertex idempotent `eᵥ` acts
  as the projection onto the summand `Mᵥ`, whence
  `TauCeti.QuiverRep.vertexComponent_asModule`: the vertex component of `asModule` at `v` is the
  image of `Mᵥ`.
* `TauCeti.QuiverRep.vertexComponentEquiv`: the vertex space `Mᵥ` is that vertex component, and
  `TauCeti.QuiverRep.pathMap_vertexComponentEquiv`: the identification is natural in the path.
* `TauCeti.QuiverRep.asModuleIso`: **the representation carried by `asModule M` is `M`**, whence
  `TauCeti.QuiverRep.asModuleShrinkIso` says the same of the small model, so
  `TauCeti.quiverRepFunctor` is essentially surjective, and being fully faithful already it is an
  equivalence.  `TauCeti.QuiverRep.dimVector_asModule` records that the dimension vector is
  unchanged.

## Implementation notes

The vertex spaces are used through the family `TauCeti.QuiverRep.vertexSpace` of
`TauCeti.RepresentationTheory.Quiver.Representation.Basic` rather than as `M.obj v` directly,
because instance search does not see the objects of `CategoryTheory.Paths Q` as vertices when it is
asked for the *family* of instances that a direct sum indexed by the vertices needs; that file's
implementation notes say more.  For the same reason the naturality squares of
`TauCeti.QuiverRep.asModuleIso` and `TauCeti.QuiverRep.asModuleShrinkIso` open with
`change Q at a`, restating their quantified objects as vertices.

The `k`-module structure on `TauCeti.QuiverRep.asModule` is deliberately **not** the one the direct
sum already carries: it is `Module.restrictScalars k (pathAlgebra k Q)`, restriction of scalars
along `algebraMap`.  That is exactly the structure `ModuleCat.moduleOfAlgebraModule` puts on an
object of `ModuleCat (kQ)`, which is the one `TauCeti.quiverRepFunctor` uses; taking the direct
sum's own structure instead would give a second, only propositionally equal, `Module k` instance
and the essential-surjectivity isomorphism would not typecheck against the functor.  That the two
agree is what makes the identification `TauCeti.QuiverRep.asModuleEquiv` with the direct sum
`k`-linear; the identity additive equivalence it upgrades is private, `asModuleEquiv` being the
identification consumers use.

`DecidableEq Q` is needed to write down the summand inclusions `DirectSum.lof`, so it is carried
through the construction; the essential-surjectivity instance is a `Prop` and discharges it with
`classical`, so neither it nor `TauCeti.quiverRepEquivalence` asks for it.

The concrete carrier is indexed by `Q : Type v` with summands in `Type t`, so
`⨁ᵥ Mᵥ : Type (max v t)`: `TauCeti.QuiverRep.asModule` lands in a larger universe than the
representation it is built from whenever the vertex type does.  `TauCeti.quiverRepEquivalence` is
nevertheless stated at an arbitrary representation universe `t`, because over a finite vertex set
that direct sum is a finite product of the vertex spaces and so has a model in `Type t`
(`TauCeti.QuiverRep.small_asModule`); the model `TauCeti.QuiverRep.asModuleShrink` of it, whose
vertex components are those of `asModule` because `TauCeti.QuiverRep.asModuleShrinkEquiv` is
`kQ`-linear, is what witnesses essential surjectivity there; `TauCeti.quiverRepEquivalence`'s
forward direction is identified with that model by
`TauCeti.quiverRepEquivalenceFunctorObjShrinkIso`.  The concrete direct-sum API is kept at
`max v t`, and `TauCeti.quiverRepEquivalenceFunctorObjIso` identifies the forward direction with
`asModule` itself at that universe.

## References

The plan of the file follows Mathlib's group-algebra analogue: the type synonym carrying a module
structure through `Module.compHom`, the equivalence with the underlying type and the shape of the
final `≌ ModuleCat (algebra)` statement are those of `Representation.asModule`,
`Representation.asModuleEquiv` and `Rep.equivalenceModuleMonoidAlgebra` for `k[G]`.
