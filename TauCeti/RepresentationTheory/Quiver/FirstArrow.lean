# The first arrow of a path

A path `a → j` in a quiver is either trivial, which forces `a = j`, or a first arrow `a ⟶ b`
followed by a path `b → j`. This file records that dichotomy as an equivalence and reads off the
resulting recursion for the number of paths into a fixed vertex.

It is the mirror image of `TauCeti.RepresentationTheory.Quiver.LastArrow`, which decomposes a path
by its *last* arrow instead, and the two feed the two sides of the Euler form of a finite quiver.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.pathFirstArrowEquiv`: the first-arrow decomposition
  `Path a j ≃ PLift (a = j) ⊕ Σ b, (a ⟶ b) × Path b j`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.exists_hom_mem_path_vertices_of_mem_dropLast`: every occurrence in a path's
  vertex list except its final occurrence is the source of an arrow landing on the path.
* `TauCeti.exists_hom_mem_path_vertices`: every vertex visited by a nontrivial closed path is
  the source of an arrow landing on the path.
* `TauCeti.card_path_eq_ite_add_sum_firstArrow`: the path count `#(a → j)` equals
  `∑_b #(a ⟶ b) · #(b → j)`, plus `1` when `a = j` for the trivial path.
* `TauCeti.Quiver.TotalPath.mk_toPath_comp_eq_mk_toPath_comp_iff`: a path out of a vertex is
  determined by its first arrow and the path after it, the mirror image of
  `TauCeti.Quiver.TotalPath.mk_cons_eq_mk_cons_iff`.

## Implementation notes

`Quiver.Path` recurses on its *target* vertex, so — unlike the last arrow, which is the head of the
`Quiver.Path.cons` constructor — the first arrow of a path is not visible to a match. The forward
map `pathFirstArrowSplit` is therefore an honest recursion over the path: on `p.cons e` it splits
`p` and, if `p` turned out to be trivial, promotes `e` to the first arrow, transporting it along the
equality of vertices with `Quiver.Hom.cast`; otherwise it appends `e` to the tail. The inverse
`pathOfFirstArrow` is the direct construction `e.toPath.comp p`, and the two round trips are
inductions over the same recursion. Both maps are `private`: the four characteristic lemmas
`TauCeti.pathFirstArrowEquiv_nil`, `TauCeti.pathFirstArrowEquiv_toPath_comp`,
`TauCeti.pathFirstArrowEquiv_symm_inl` and `TauCeti.pathFirstArrowEquiv_symm_inr` are the whole
public interface, and consumers never unfold the equivalence.

The proposition `a = j` is wrapped in `PLift` only to make the summand a type, so that `Nat.card`
applies, exactly as in the last-arrow decomposition.
