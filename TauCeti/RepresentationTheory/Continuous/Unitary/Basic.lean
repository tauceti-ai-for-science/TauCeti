# Unitary continuous representations

This file defines when a continuous representation preserves a real or complex inner product. It
characterizes unitarity through norm preservation, isometries, and Mathlib's `unitary` submonoid of
continuous linear operators, and records the basic inner-product identities, the coefficient bound,
and that unitarity passes to restrictions.

The operator characterizations reuse Mathlib's adjoint and unitary-operator theory.

The mathematical development follows Daniel Bump, *Lie Groups*, second edition, Chapters 2–4.
