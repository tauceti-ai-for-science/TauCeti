# Tensor induction of discrete continuous representations

For an open finite-index subgroup `U ≤ G`, tensor induction of a discrete continuous
`U`-module is again a discrete continuous `G`-module. The tensor power is given the discrete
topology, not a topology inferred from an algebraic tensor product. Continuity follows because
a pure tensor involves finitely many continuous coordinate actions; sums of pure tensors then
exhaust the tensor power.

`TauCeti.DiscreteRep.tensorInductionFunctor` is the continuous-coefficient version of
`Subgroup.tensorInductionFunctor`. Composing it with `TauCeti.toSmoothDiscrete` supplies
coefficients for Mathlib's continuous cohomology. In particular this makes the tensor induction
used in the general Evens norm available on discrete coefficients, rather than only in `Rep`.
The scalar ring is discrete; this includes both `ℤ` and `ZMod 2`. No compactness of `G` is needed:
openness and finite index are separate hypotheses.
