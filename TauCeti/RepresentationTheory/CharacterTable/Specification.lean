# The specification a character table satisfies, and the labeled uniqueness it forces

Let `G` be a finite group. Its complex character table `TauCeti.characterTable ℂ G` is a square
matrix whose rows are indexed by an arbitrary enumeration of the irreducible characters and whose
columns are labeled by the conjugacy classes themselves. This file writes down a property
`TauCeti.IsCharacterTableSpec` of an *arbitrary* such matrix, proves that the character table has
it, and proves that it pins the character table down: **any matrix with this property is the
character table up to a permutation of its rows**.

The property is the checker of the Burnside--Dixon--Schneider algorithm. Its three ingredients are
the data that algorithm produces and can verify without knowing any representation theory:

* the identity column consists of positive integers dividing `|G|` whose squares sum to `|G|`;
* the rows are orthonormal for the class-size weighted Hermitian pairing;
* each **normalized row** `ω_i(K_C) = |C| · M i C / M i 1` (`TauCeti.centralCharacterRow`) is a
  common left eigenrow of the class-multiplication matrices, the eigenvalue at `C` being its own
  value there.

Uniqueness is the reason this is worth having: an algorithm that returns *a* matrix passing the
checker has returned *the* character table. The proof matches each normalized row with a row of the
central character table `Ω` (`TauCeti.isClassEigenrow_iff_exists_centralCharacterTable_eq`, which
identifies the normalized common left eigenrows with the central characters of the irreducibles),
recovers the degree of that irreducible from the self-pairing of the row, and reads the ordinary row
off `Ω` by `TauCeti.characterTable_eq_div`. Distinct rows of the matrix stay distinct because
orthonormality forbids repetitions, so the matching is a permutation.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.centralCharacterRow`: the normalized row `ω_i` of a candidate character table.
* `TauCeti.IsCharacterTableSpec`: the specification itself.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.isCharacterTableSpec_characterTable`: **the character table satisfies the
  specification**.
* `TauCeti.characterTable_unique_rows`: **labeled uniqueness**, a matrix satisfying the
  specification is the character table up to a permutation of rows. With
  `TauCeti.IsCharacterTableSpec.submatrix`, that a row permutation preserves the specification, this
  becomes the characterization `TauCeti.isCharacterTableSpec_iff_exists_perm` of the matrices
  satisfying it, and `TauCeti.IsCharacterTableSpec.exists_perm_eq`: any two of them differ by a
  permutation of rows.
* `TauCeti.IsCharacterTableSpec.sum_apply_mk_one_eq_sum_characterDegree`: the identity column of
  such a matrix sums to the sum of the character degrees.
* `TauCeti.IsCharacterTableSpec.exists_eq_characterTable`: the row-by-row form of uniqueness, that
  every row is a row of the character table.

## Implementation notes

The specification is stated over `ℂ`, where the roadmap pins it: its orthonormality condition is
the Hermitian one, which is the form the algorithm checks. The normalized row
`TauCeti.centralCharacterRow` needs no such restriction and is defined over any field, so that
`TauCeti.centralCharacterRow_characterTable` (the normalized rows of the character table are the
rows of the central character table) is available wherever the two tables are. Normalizing reads
only the row it is given, so it is also defined for a matrix with any row index type, and only
`TauCeti.centralCharacterRow_characterTable` and the specification itself ask for the character
table's.

The group is an explicit argument of `TauCeti.IsCharacterTableSpec`, as the roadmap pins it: the
specification is read as a statement about `G`, and `IsCharacterTableSpec G M` says what it says
without having to recover `G` from the type of `M`.

Three of the four conditions do the work in `TauCeti.characterTable_unique_rows`: the positivity
and integrality of the degrees, row orthonormality, and the eigenrow condition. The divisibility
`dᵢ ∣ |G|` and the identity `∑ dᵢ² = |G|` are part of the checker as the roadmap pins it, being
what the algorithm tests after the eigenvector search and before lifting; they are recorded here
because the character table satisfies them, not because uniqueness needs them.
