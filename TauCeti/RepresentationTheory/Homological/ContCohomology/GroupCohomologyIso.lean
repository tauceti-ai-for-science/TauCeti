# The explicit continuous complex of a discrete group is Mathlib's inhomogeneous complex

For a group `G` carrying the *discrete* topology every continuity condition in the explicit
low-degree complex of continuous cochains is vacuous, so that complex is literally Mathlib's
complex of inhomogeneous cochains of the representation `Rep.ofDistribMulAction ℤ G M`. This file
proves that, degree by degree, and concludes with the three additive isomorphisms

```text
H⁰(G, M) ≃+ H⁰_grp(G, M),   H¹(G, M) ≃+ H¹_grp(G, M),   H²(G, M) ≃+ H²_grp(G, M).
```

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.ContCohomology.explicitH0IsoGroupCohomology`,
  `TauCeti.ContCohomology.explicitH1IsoGroupCohomology` and
  `TauCeti.ContCohomology.explicitH2IsoGroupCohomology`: the three comparison isomorphisms.
* `TauCeti.ContCohomology.explicitH1AddEquivGroupCohomology` and
  `TauCeti.ContCohomology.explicitH2AddEquivGroupCohomology`: the same comparison for a
  representation `B : Rep k H` over any coefficient ring, along a group isomorphism `G ≃* H` and an
  equivariant additive isomorphism `M ≃+ B`; the comparisons in degrees `1` and `2` are their
  instances along the identities.
* `TauCeti.ContCohomology.H0AddEquivInvariants`,
  `TauCeti.ContCohomology.Z1AddEquivCocycles₁` and
  `TauCeti.ContCohomology.Z2AddEquivCocycles₂`: the underlying identifications of the numerators,
  which is where the mathematical content sits; the two isomorphisms in degrees `1` and `2` are
  the induced maps on the subquotients, and in degree `0` there is no denominator to divide by.

Degree `0` needs no topological hypothesis whatever, and degree `1` needs discreteness only for
the cocycles: `B¹` is the image of *all* of `M`, so it never sees a continuity condition. It is
degree `2` where discreteness enters the denominator, `B²` being the image of the continuous
`1`-cochains.

## Main statements

* `TauCeti.ContCohomology.C1_eq_top` and `TauCeti.ContCohomology.C2_eq_top`: over a discrete group
  every cochain is continuous.
* `TauCeti.ContCohomology.d0_apply_eq_d₀₁_hom_apply` and its degree-`1` and degree-`2`
  counterparts: the explicit differentials are Mathlib's, on the nose.
* `TauCeti.ContCohomology.mem_cocycles₁_iff_mem_Z1`,
  `TauCeti.ContCohomology.mem_coboundaries₁_iff_mem_B1` and their degree-`2` and degree-`0`
  counterparts: the dictionary between the two sets of cocycles and coboundaries.

## Implementation notes

The universes are pinned by the pin and not by the mathematics. Mathlib's low-degree
`groupCohomology` comparison API forces the group and coefficient module into `Type 0` when the
coefficient ring is `ℤ`. Thus the three final comparison isomorphisms carry `G M : Type`, while the
differentials, membership dictionaries, and numerator equivalences keep every universe not
constrained by Mathlib's representation API arbitrary. `C1_eq_top` and `C2_eq_top` mention nothing
of Mathlib's theory and are fully polymorphic, and so are `G` and `M` in the comparisons along a
compatible pair, where only `k` and `H` share a universe. When the pin drops these restrictions the
binders here can simply be widened.

The isomorphisms are built as `AddEquiv`s and not as isomorphisms in `ModuleCat ℤ`. The explicit
`H¹` and `H²` are bare additive groups by construction, their inherited quotient topology being the
wrong one; `TauCeti.ContCohomology.DiscreteH1` and `DiscreteH2` are the carriers used when a
topology is wanted, and the comparison with the *canonical* continuous cohomology is where that
choice matters. Against `groupCohomology` there is no topology on either side, so an additive
isomorphism is the whole statement.

`Rep.ofDistribMulAction ℤ G M` is Mathlib's translation of an unbundled `DistribMulAction` into
`Rep ℤ G`; the `ℤ`-linearity of the comparison is automatic and is not restated, because the
explicit complex is a complex of additive groups. Mathlib's `cocyclesOfIsCocycle₁`,
`isCocycle₁_of_mem_cocycles₁` and their siblings prove the same dictionary as the four membership
lemmas here, but they are stated for `{k G A : Type u}` — all three in one universe — so they are
not reused; the proofs below go through `groupCohomology.mem_cocycles₁_iff` and
`mem_cocycles₂_iff`, which carry no such constraint.

This implements the "continuous against discrete" milestone of Layer 3 of the human-authored
roadmap at `TauCetiRoadmap/ProfiniteCohomology/README.md`, whose `Suggested.lean` fixes the names
`explicitH0IsoGroupCohomology`, `explicitH1IsoGroupCohomology` and `explicitH2IsoGroupCohomology`.

/-! ### Along a compatible pair, over any coefficient ring

A module met in practice is usually a representation `B : Rep k H` over a larger coefficient ring
`k`, of a group `H` that is only isomorphic to `G`, on a carrier that is only isomorphic to `M`.
Along a group isomorphism `φ : G ≃* H` and an additive isomorphism `ψ : M ≃+ B` intertwining the two
actions, the explicit `H¹` and `H²` of `M` are those of `B`. The coefficient ring plays no role: a
cocycle of `B` over `k` is the same function as a cocycle of its underlying additive group.

Mathlib's `groupCohomology.mapIso` transports along a group isomorphism and a `k`-linear
isomorphism of representations over one coefficient ring; here `M` is only an additive group, so
the comparison is built on cocycles directly. The identities `φ = .refl G`, `ψ = .refl M` give
`explicitH1IsoGroupCohomology` and `explicitH2IsoGroupCohomology` below. -/
