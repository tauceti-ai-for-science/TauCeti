# Smooth discrete topological representations

An object `X : TopRep R G` carries one continuous operator `X.ρ g` per group element, and nothing
in that data forces the assignment `g ↦ X.ρ g` to be continuous in the group variable. So an
object whose underlying module happens to be discrete can still have non-open point stabilizers,
and there is no dictionary between all of `TopRep R G` and the discrete `G`-modules of Mathlib's
unbundled classes.

This file cuts out the subcategory where such a dictionary does exist. `TauCeti.IsSmoothDiscrete`
says that the underlying module is discrete and that every set `{g | X.ρ g x = x}` is open, which
for a discrete module over a topological *group* is exactly continuity of the action;
`TauCeti.ofDiscreteModule` turns a discrete `G`-module into an object of `TopRep R G`; and on the
discrete `G`-modules whose `G`-action is continuous — not on all of them — the two translations are
shown to be mutually inverse, both on objects and on morphisms.

The construction `TauCeti.ofDiscreteModule` itself is available for *every* discrete `G`-module,
since a discrete module makes each operator continuous whatever the action does in the group
variable. It is only its *smoothness* that needs `ContinuousSMul G M`, and that hypothesis cannot
be dropped: `TauCeti.not_isSmoothDiscrete_ofDiscreteModule_units_zmod` exhibits a discrete module
with a discontinuous action whose object is discrete but not smooth. So the source side of the
dictionary is the discrete `G`-modules with continuous `G`-action, and the image of the
unrestricted construction is larger than the smooth discrete subcategory.

The general smoothness facts for trivial topological representations also live here, since they
provide the basic examples of smooth discrete objects used by coefficient constructions.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.ofDiscreteModule`: a discrete `G`-module as an object of `TopRep R G`.
* `TauCeti.IsSmoothDiscrete`: the objects of `TopRep R G` whose underlying module is discrete and
  whose point stabilizers are open.
* `TopRep.distribMulAction`: the `G`-action on the underlying module of an object of
  `TopRep R G`, read off from its operators.
* `TauCeti.ofDiscreteModuleMap`: a `G`-equivariant `R`-linear map of discrete modules as a
  morphism of `TopRep R G`.
* `TauCeti.ofDiscreteModuleIso`: a `G`-equivariant `R`-linear equivalence of discrete modules as an
  isomorphism of `TopRep R G`.
* `TauCeti.ofDiscreteModulePair`: a compatible pair `(φ : H →* G, f : M →ₗ[R] N)` as the morphism
  `TopRep.res φ (ofDiscreteModule R G M) ⟶ ofDiscreteModule R H N` that
  `ContinuousCohomology.map` consumes.
* `TauCeti.SmoothDiscreteTopRep`, `TauCeti.smoothDiscreteι`: the smooth discrete objects as a full
  subcategory of `TopRep R G`, and its inclusion functor.
* `TauCeti.DiscreteRep`: the discrete `G`-modules with continuous `G`-action as a category, the
  source side of the dictionary in bundled form; its morphisms are Mathlib's
  `Representation.IntertwiningMap`s.
* `TauCeti.toSmoothDiscrete`, `TauCeti.ofSmoothDiscrete`: the two translations as functors.
* `TauCeti.smoothDiscreteResFunctor`: restriction to a subgroup as a functor between the smooth
  discrete subcategories; `TauCeti.smoothDiscreteResTopRep` is its object map as a transparent
  abbreviation.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.isSmoothDiscrete_iff_continuousSMul`: for a topological group, smoothness of a discrete
  object is continuity of the action map `G × X.V → X.V`.
* `TauCeti.isSmoothDiscrete_iff_discreteTopology_and_isContinuous`: the predicate is Mathlib's
  `Action.IsContinuous` together with discreteness, read on `Action (TopModuleCat R) G` through
  `TopRep.toActionTopModFunc`, so the subcategory below is Mathlib's `DiscreteContAction` carried
  across `TopRep.TopRepEquivActionTop` rather than a second notion.
* `TauCeti.ofDiscreteModule_isSmoothDiscrete`: a discrete `G`-module with continuous `G`-action
  lands in the subcategory.
* `TauCeti.ofDiscreteModule_eq_self`: conversely, a discrete object *is* the image of its own
  underlying module.
* `TauCeti.ofDiscreteModuleHomAddEquiv`: morphisms between objects in the image are exactly the
  `G`-equivariant `R`-linear maps.
* `TauCeti.ofDiscreteModulePair_eq_of_hom_apply`: the compatible pair is the only morphism with its
  underlying map, which is how statements phrased with it are specialised;
  `TauCeti.ofDiscreteModulePair_heq_of_hom_apply` is its heterogeneous form, for group
  homomorphisms that agree only propositionally.
* `TauCeti.res_ofDiscreteModule`: the dictionary commutes with restriction to a subgroup, on the
  nose.
* `TauCeti.isSmoothDiscrete_of_ρ_apply_eq_self`: a discrete object with trivial action is smooth
  discrete.
* `TauCeti.IsSmoothDiscrete.res`: smoothness is inherited by restriction along a continuous
  homomorphism.
* `TauCeti.isSmoothDiscrete_trivial`: a trivial representation on a discrete module is smooth
  discrete.
* `TauCeti.discreteRepEquivSmoothTopRep`: for a topological group `G`, the two translations are an
  equivalence of categories between `TauCeti.DiscreteRep R G` and
  `TauCeti.SmoothDiscreteTopRep R G`.
* `TauCeti.not_isSmoothDiscrete_ofDiscreteModule_units_zmod`: a discrete object that is not
  smooth, so the subcategory is proper and the continuity hypothesis above is needed.

## Implementation notes

* The coefficient ring is an arbitrary topological ring `R`, and the group is only a `Monoid`
  wherever the proofs allow. The equivalence of categories is stated for a topological group:
  over a topological monoid, open point stabilizers need not make the action continuous.
* `TauCeti.ofDiscreteModule` takes `R` and `G` explicitly, since neither is determined by the
  module `M` alone.
* `TauCeti.DiscreteRep` carries a field `continuousSMulRing` for `ContinuousSMul R V`, without
  which the underlying module is not an object of `TopModuleCat R` and `TauCeti.ofDiscreteModule`
  does not apply.
* Morphisms of `TauCeti.DiscreteRep` are Mathlib's `Representation.IntertwiningMap`s rather than a
  new structure, continuity being automatic on discrete modules.

The carrier `TopRep` and its functoriality are Mathlib's, and are consumed rather than restated.

section NotSmooth

/-- An object of `TopRep R G` whose underlying module is discrete need not be smooth. Here the
two-element group `(ZMod 3)ˣ` acts on the discrete module `ZMod 3` by multiplication, so the
stabilizer of `1` is the singleton `{1}`; giving the group the indiscrete topology `⊤`, whose only
open sets are `∅` and the whole group, makes that singleton non-open. The statement names that
topology explicitly: it is not the topology `(ZMod 3)ˣ` has as the unit group of the discrete ring
`ZMod 3`, for which the same object is smooth. This is why the dictionary above has the discrete
`G`-modules *with continuous `G`-action* as its source, and it is what the hypothesis
`ContinuousSMul G M` of `TauCeti.ofDiscreteModule_isSmoothDiscrete` rules out. Stating it needs
`TauCeti.ofDiscreteModule` to be available without that hypothesis, which is why the hypothesis
sits on the results that use it rather than on the construction. -/
