# Short exact sequences of discrete modules, and the low-degree connecting maps

A short exact sequence `0 → A → B → C → 0` of **discrete** `G`-modules induces short exact
sequences of *continuous* cochains

```text
0 → Cⁿ(G, A) → Cⁿ(G, B) → Cⁿ(G, C) → 0,
```

and hence connecting homomorphisms `δ⁰ : H⁰(G, C) → H¹(G, A)` and `δ¹ : H¹(G, C) → H²(G, A)` on
the explicit low-degree complex of
`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/Homological/ContCohomology/LowDegree.lean`. This file builds both.

Discreteness of the coefficients is used twice, once at each of the two ends of the sequence.
Discreteness of `C` gives surjectivity on cochains: a continuous cochain into `C` is locally
constant, so composing it with *any* set-theoretic section of `B → C` is still continuous
(`TauCeti.exists_continuous_lift`). Discreteness of `B` gives exactness in the middle: every
function out of `B` is continuous, so the retraction onto the image of `incl` is continuous, and a
continuous cochain into `B` that the projection kills retracts to a *continuous* cochain into `A`
(`TauCeti.ContCohomology.DiscreteShortExact.exists_continuous_incl_comp_eq`, whence
`C1_map_incl_eq_inf_ker`). Cocycle conditions descend along `incl` because an injection into a
discrete space reflects continuity (`TauCeti.continuous_of_injective_comp`). Discreteness of `A`
and of `B` is also what makes `incl` and `proj` continuous. For general
topological coefficients neither argument applies, since a set-theoretic section need not be
continuous and a continuous cochain need not be locally constant; the cochain sequence can still
be exact when suitable continuous lifts exist. Nothing below is asserted in that more general
setting.

The sequence is carried by a structure rather than by loose hypotheses because every statement
here is about the same sequence and has to name the same two coefficient maps.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.ContCohomology.DiscreteShortExact`: a short exact sequence of discrete `G`-modules.
* `TauCeti.ContCohomology.DiscreteShortExact.toShortComplex`: the sequence as a short
  complex of canonical topological coefficient representations.
* `TauCeti.ContCohomology.DiscreteShortExact.restrict`: the same sequence over a subgroup.
* `TauCeti.ContCohomology.DiscreteShortExact.ofAddSubgroup`: the sequence `0 → N → B → B ⧸ N → 0`
  of a `G`-stable additive subgroup `N` of a discrete `G`-module `B`.
* `TauCeti.ContCohomology.DiscreteShortExact.dual`: the dual sequence
  `0 → Hom(C, N) → Hom(B, N) → Hom(A, N) → 0` of internal homs with the conjugation action,
  whenever homomorphisms `A →+ N` extend to `B`, as they do for a sequence killed by a prime `p`
  and for a sequence killed by `n` when `N` is an injective `ℤ/nℤ`-module; its maps are
  precomposition with the projection and the inclusion, which `evalPairing_dual_incl` and
  `evalPairing_dual_proj` record as compatibilities of the evaluation pairings.
* `TauCeti.ContCohomology.DiscreteShortExact.inclDistribMulActionHom` and
  `TauCeti.ContCohomology.DiscreteShortExact.projDistribMulActionHom`: the inclusion and projection
  bundled as equivariant additive homomorphisms, suitable as inputs to `explicitCoeff0`.
  `TauCeti.ContCohomology.DiscreteShortExact.ofDiscreteModuleMap_inclDistribMulActionHom` and
  `TauCeti.ContCohomology.DiscreteShortExact.ofDiscreteModuleMap_projDistribMulActionHom` identify
  their canonical coefficient maps with those of the raw homomorphisms.
* `TauCeti.ContCohomology.DiscreteShortExact.explicitDelta0` and
  `TauCeti.ContCohomology.DiscreteShortExact.explicitDelta1`: the connecting homomorphisms
  `H⁰(G, C) → H¹(G, A)` and `H¹(G, C) → H²(G, A)`.

## Main statements

* `TauCeti.ContCohomology.DiscreteShortExact.compLeft_incl_injective`,
  `C1_map_incl_eq_inf_ker` and `C1_map_proj_eq_C1`: exactness of
  `0 → C¹(X, A) → C¹(X, B) → C¹(X, C) → 0` at its left, middle and right nodes, with
  `C2_map_incl_eq_inf_ker` and `C2_map_proj_eq_C2` the degree-`2` instances of the last two.
* `TauCeti.ContCohomology.DiscreteShortExact.mem_Z1_of_incl_comp_mem_Z1` and
  `mem_Z2_of_incl_comp_mem_Z2`: the continuous cocycles descend along the inclusion, which is what
  turns a cochain produced by a diagram chase back into a cocycle on `A`.
* `TauCeti.ContCohomology.DiscreteShortExact.explicitDelta0_apply` and
  `explicitDelta1_apply`: the two connecting maps evaluated on representatives, in the shape of
  Mathlib's discrete `groupCohomology.δ₀_apply` and `δ₁_apply`. They hold for an *arbitrary*
  preimage and an arbitrary representing cochain, so they are also the public form of the
  well-definedness of the two maps. The cocycle proofs in their conclusions are
  `TauCeti.ContCohomology.DiscreteShortExact.mem_Z1_of_incl_comp_eq_d0` and
  `mem_Z2_of_incl_comp_eq_d1`, which need no cocycle input of their own.

## Implementation notes

Continuity of `incl` and of `proj` is *not* carried as data: `A` and `B` are discrete, so every
map out of them is continuous. Exactness in the middle is Mathlib's `Function.Exact`, which is
`∀ b, proj b = 0 ↔ b ∈ Set.range incl`.

The cochain maps are Mathlib's `AddMonoidHom.compLeft`, postcomposition on a function space; the
statements of exactness are therefore about the image and kernel of that homomorphism restricted
to the cochain subgroup `C¹ X -`, which is `C¹(G, -)` at `X = G` and `C²(G, -)` at `X = G × G`.
The compatible-pair pullback, which moves the group as well as the coefficients, is a different
map and is not used here.

Both connecting maps are built from a *variable* preimage first, and the independence of the
choice is a theorem rather than a definitional accident; only then is the map defined by choosing
a preimage with `Function.surjInv`. The cochain-level constructions this passes through are
private, including the retraction used on the kernel of the projection, since they depend on
choices the mathematical statements must not mention; the public interface to them is
`explicitDelta0_apply` and `explicitDelta1_apply`, which hold with whatever preimage a computation
has in hand.

The cochain sequences are stated for a topological monoid `G`. The two connecting maps ask in
addition that the coefficients be discrete `G`-modules with a *continuous* action:
`[ContinuousSMul G A]` and `[ContinuousSMul G B]` for `δ⁰`, and also `[ContinuousSMul G C]` for
`δ¹`. Without it `B¹ ≤ Z¹` and `B² ≤ Z²` fail and the quotients `H1` and `H2` cannot be formed.
`δ¹` asks moreover for a continuous multiplication on `G`, which is what carries continuity
through `d¹`. Restricting the sequence to a subgroup (`DiscreteShortExact.restrict`) and the
dual sequence (`DiscreteShortExact.dual`, whose conjugation action needs inverses) ask `G` to be a
group. Profiniteness plays no part here.

Discreteness of the three modules is what makes the continuous cochain sequences exact:
discreteness of `C` makes arbitrary set-theoretic lifts of continuous cochains continuous, and
discreteness of `B` makes the retraction onto the image of the inclusion continuous, which is
what retracts a continuous cochain killed by the projection. Continuity of the two maps is a
further consequence of it, not data. -/

the exactness of `S`: injectivity on the left is `InternalHom.precomp_injective` and exactness in
