# Herbrand quotients of finite cyclic group representations

For a representation `M` of a finite cyclic group, its Herbrand quotient is the quotient of the
orders of `H-hat^0(G, M)` and `H-hat^(-1)(G, M)`. This file defines it directly on Mathlib's
Tate-cohomology carrier, on top of the low-degree descriptions

`H-hat^0(G, M) = M^G / N M` and `H-hat^(-1)(G, M) = ker(N) / I_G M`,

and proves its two base calculations: the quotient is `1` for a finite module, and it is `|G|`
for the trivial integral representation. Both low-degree Tate groups of a finite module are
finite, since each is a subquotient of the module itself. By two-periodicity it is also the
classical ratio `|H²(G, M)| / |H¹(G, M)|` of ordinary group cohomology, so that it computes the
order of `H²(G, M)` whenever `H¹(G, M)` vanishes.

It then proves that the Herbrand quotient is **multiplicative in a short exact sequence**. The
argument is the classical exact hexagon: the periodic chain complex of
`TauCeti.RepresentationTheory.Homological.TateCohomology.Periodic` is a functor of the
coefficients, so a short exact sequence of representations gives a short exact sequence of
complexes and hence a long exact sequence of homology groups, which alternates between the
degree-`0` and the degree-`-1` Tate groups; naturality of the periodicity in odd degrees splices
that sequence into a cycle of six maps. Counting each of the six groups against the image of the
map leaving it and the image of the map entering it gives the identity
`|H-hat^0(X₁)| |H-hat^0(X₃)| |H-hat^(-1)(X₂)| =
|H-hat^(-1)(X₁)| |H-hat^(-1)(X₃)| |H-hat^0(X₂)|`, which is multiplicativity once the
degree-`-1` orders are known to be nonzero.

The same hexagon gives the **invariance** of the Herbrand quotient: a short exact sequence with a
finite outer term has the same quotient at the two remaining terms, and therefore a morphism with
finite kernel and cokernel, factored through its image, leaves the quotient unchanged. Invariance
is what lets an arithmetic computation of a Herbrand quotient replace a module by a commensurable
one, such as a unit group by a lattice on which the group acts freely.
This invariance construction follows E. Artin and J. Tate, *Class Field Theory*, Chapter IX,
section 4.

The proofs are adapted to Mathlib's current Tate complex from the corresponding calculations in
`ClassFieldTheory/Cohomology/FiniteCyclic/HerbrandQuotient/{Defs,Finite,Trivial}.lean` in
`kbuzzard/ClassFieldTheory`, commit `ccc3323c6750abca25b49b35106f54eb3a398509`. The trivial
integral calculation reads off the low-degree evaluations
`natCard_tateCohomology_zero_trivial_int_eq_card` and
`subsingleton_tateCohomology_negOne_trivial_int`.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.TateCohomology.herbrandQuotient` is the Herbrand quotient.
* `TauCeti.TateCohomology.herbrandQuotient_eq_one_of_finite` computes it for a finite module.
* `TauCeti.TateCohomology.herbrandQuotient_trivial_int_eq_card` computes it for trivial integral
  coefficients.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.TateCohomology.herbrandQuotient_eq_natCard_H2_div_natCard_H1`: the Herbrand quotient
  is `|H²(G, M)| / |H¹(G, M)|`; `TauCeti.TateCohomology.herbrandQuotient_eq_natCard_H2` is the
  case `H¹(G, M) = 0`.
* `TauCeti.TateCohomology.herbrandQuotient_eq_of_iso`: isomorphic representations have the same
  Herbrand quotient.
* `TauCeti.TateCohomology.herbrandQuotient_coind`: **Shapiro's lemma for Herbrand quotients**,
  `h_G(Coind_S^G A) = h_S(A)` for a subgroup `S` of a finite cyclic group `G`.
* `TauCeti.TateCohomology.herbrandQuotient_res_of_bijective`: restriction along an isomorphism of
  finite groups does not change the Herbrand quotient.
* `TauCeti.TateCohomology.natCard_tateCohomology_mul_of_shortExact`: the exact hexagon of a short
  exact sequence, in the form of an identity between two products of three orders. It assumes no
  finiteness.
* `TauCeti.TateCohomology.natCard_tateCohomology_negOne_dvd_of_shortExact`: the order of the
  middle degree-`-1` Tate group divides the product of the two outer ones.
* `TauCeti.TateCohomology.herbrandQuotient_eq_mul_of_shortExact`: **multiplicativity of the
  Herbrand quotient** in a short exact sequence whose outer terms have finite degree-`-1` Tate
  cohomology.
* `TauCeti.TateCohomology.herbrandQuotient_eq_div_of_shortExact`: the Herbrand quotient of the
  last term of a short exact sequence is the quotient of those of the other two, when the first
  term has finite Tate cohomology and the middle term finite degree-`-1` Tate cohomology.
* `TauCeti.TateCohomology.herbrandQuotient_eq_of_shortExact_of_finite_X₁` and
  `TauCeti.TateCohomology.herbrandQuotient_eq_of_shortExact_of_finite_X₃`: a finite outer term of
  a short exact sequence may be discarded.
* `TauCeti.TateCohomology.herbrandQuotient_eq_of_epi_of_finite_kernel` and
  `TauCeti.TateCohomology.herbrandQuotient_eq_of_mono_of_finite_cokernel`: the one-sided forms.
* `TauCeti.TateCohomology.herbrandQuotient_eq_of_finite_kernel_of_finite_cokernel`:
  **invariance of the Herbrand quotient** under a morphism with finite kernel and cokernel.

/-- **Shapiro's lemma for Herbrand quotients.** For a subgroup `S` of a finite cyclic group `G` and
a representation `A` of `S`, the coinduced representation `Coind_S^G A` has the same Herbrand
quotient over `G` as `A` has over `S`. Both quotients are ratios `|H²| / |H¹|` of ordinary group
cohomology, `S` being cyclic as well, and Shapiro's lemma `groupCohomology.coindIso` identifies the
cohomology of `Coind_S^G A` with that of `A` in every degree.

This computes the Herbrand quotient of a module whose factors are permuted transitively by `G`
from that of the stabilizer of one factor. For a cyclic extension `L/K` of number fields and a
place `v` of `K`, the module `∏_{w ∣ v} L_wˣ` is coinduced in this way from the decomposition group
of one place `w` acting on `L_wˣ`. -/
