# The Peter-Weyl block of a compact group is `End(V_π)`, equivariantly

For a compact group `G`, the `π`-block `TauCeti.peterWeylBlock` of `L²(G)` is the span of the matrix
coefficients of an irreducible model `π`, and
`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/Compact/IsotypicBlock/Basic.lean` identifies it with the
endomorphisms of the model's carrier by matching a matrix position with a matrix unit. That
identification is built from a basis, so it says nothing about group actions. This file supplies
the equivariant form.

The `L²` trace coefficient `ContRepresentation.traceCoeffLp` sends an operator `T` on the carrier to
the class of `x ↦ trace (T ∘ π x⁻¹)`. It is basis-free, it carries the rank-one operator
`rankOne 𝕜 w v` to the matrix coefficient of `v` and `w`, and its range is exactly the block
(`TauCeti.range_traceCoeffLp`). Its point is the two-sided equivariance
(`ContRepresentation.biRegularLp_traceCoeffLp`): the biregular action
`((g, h) · f) x = f (g⁻¹ * x * h)` on `L²(G)`, built in
`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/Compact/BiregularRepresentation.lean`, corresponds under it to the
two-sided conjugation `T ↦ π g ∘ T ∘ π h⁻¹` of `ContRepresentation.biLinHom π π`. The trace is
cyclic, which is the whole proof.

Counting dimensions turns that into an **equivalence of `G × G`-representations**. The block of an
irreducible model over an algebraically closed field has dimension `(dim V_π)²`
(`TauCeti.finrank_peterWeylBlock`), which is the dimension of the operator space, so the trace
coefficient is injective as well as onto and `TauCeti.biLinHomEquivPeterWeylBlock` is an
equivalence

`End(V_π) ≃ (π-block of L²(G))`

of representations of `G × G`. The isometric normalization and assembly over a skeleton of
irreducibles are in `TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/Compact/TraceCoefficient/Isometry.lean` and
`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/Compact/TraceCoefficient/HilbertSum.lean`. They combine the
normalized trace maps with the Hilbert-sum decomposition of Peter-Weyl blocks.

## Main definitions

* `ContRepresentation.traceCoeffLp`: the trace coefficient as a linear map into `L²(G)`.
* `ContRepresentation.matrixCoeffLpIntertwiner`: the matrix-coefficient map in its second vector
  as an intertwiner into the left regular representation.
* `TauCeti.peterWeylBlockRep`: a Peter-Weyl block as a `G × G`-subrepresentation of `L²(G)` under
  the biregular action.
* `TauCeti.traceCoeffBlock`: the trace coefficient of a model, corestricted to its block.
* `TauCeti.biLinHomEquivPeterWeylBlock`: **for an algebraically closed `𝕜` the block is the
  endomorphism algebra of its model as a `G × G`-representation.**

## Main statements

* `ContRepresentation.traceCoeffLp_rankOne`: a rank-one operator pairs to a matrix coefficient.
* `ContRepresentation.traceCoeffLp_eq_sum`: a trace coefficient is a sum of matrix coefficients
  over an orthonormal basis.
* `ContRepresentation.biRegularLp_traceCoeffLp`: **the trace coefficient intertwines two-sided
  conjugation of operators with bi-translation in `L²(G)`**, with
  `ContRepresentation.leftRegularLp_traceCoeffLp` and
  `ContRepresentation.rightRegularLp_traceCoeffLp` as its two one-sided shadows.
* `TauCeti.range_traceCoeffLp`: the trace coefficients of a model are exactly its Peter-Weyl block.
* `TauCeti.surjective_traceCoeffBlock` and `TauCeti.bijective_traceCoeffBlock`: the trace
  coefficient is onto its block, and bijective onto it for an algebraically closed `𝕜`.
* `TauCeti.isUnitary_peterWeylBlockRep` and `TauCeti.continuous_peterWeylBlockRep`: a block is a
  unitary `G × G`-representation, with a continuous operator-valued action.
* `TauCeti.coe_endEquivPeterWeylBlock_basis_end_eq_smul_traceCoeffLp_rankOne`: at a matrix unit of
  the canonical basis, the comparison of
  `TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/Compact/IsotypicBlock/Basic.lean` is the trace coefficient of the
  transposed rank-one operator, scaled by `√(dim V_π)`.

## Implementation notes

Two comparisons of a block with the operators of its model now coexist, and they are genuinely
different maps. `TauCeti.endEquivPeterWeylBlock` matches the matrix unit at a position with the
normalized matrix coefficient at that position, in the canonical basis; the trace coefficient
reaches the same matrix coefficient from the matrix unit at the *transposed* position
(`TauCeti.coe_endEquivPeterWeylBlock_basis_end_eq_smul_traceCoeffLp_rankOne`). Transposition is
not equivariant for `ContRepresentation.biLinHom π π` — it conjugates that action into the one
built from the contragredient of `π` — so the basis-built comparison cannot be reused for the
equivariant statement, and rescaling it cannot repair this. The trace pairing is also defined
without choosing a basis, without an inner product on the carrier and without assuming `𝕜`
algebraically closed: only the comparison with the matrix coefficients needs
`[InnerProductSpace 𝕜 V]`, and only the passage from "onto the block" to "bijective onto the
block" needs the dimension count, hence
`[IsAlgClosed 𝕜]`.
