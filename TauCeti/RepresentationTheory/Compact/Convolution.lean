# Convolution operators on `L²` of a compact group

For a continuous kernel `k : C(G, 𝕜)` on a compact group `G` and an `L²` function `f`, the
convolution

`(k * f) x = ∫ y, k (x * y⁻¹) * f y ∂(haarProb G)`

makes sense at *every* point `x`, not merely almost everywhere: the integral is the `L²` pairing of
`f` against the continuous function `y ↦ conj (k (x * y⁻¹))`, and that function varies continuously
with `x` in the uniform norm. Convolution therefore smooths `L²(G)` into `C(G)`, and the resulting
map `convolutionCLM k : L²(G) →L[𝕜] C(G)` is bounded by the uniform norm of the kernel.

Composing with `ContinuousMap.toLp` gives the convolution operator `convolutionOperator k` on
`L²(G)`. Its properties are proved here: it is self-adjoint when the kernel is symmetric
(`k g⁻¹ = conj (k g)`), it commutes with right translation and, for a central kernel,
with left translation. It is also a **compact operator**.
Together these say that the eigenspace of a symmetric convolution operator at a nonzero eigenvalue
is a *finite-dimensional* right-translation-invariant subspace of `L²(G)` all of whose elements
have continuous representatives, and that such eigenspaces exist; the eigenspaces at *all*
eigenvalues, the possibly infinite-dimensional kernel included, together span a dense subspace.
This is how the Peter-Weyl theorem manufactures finite-dimensional representations of `G` without
presupposing that any exist.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.convolutionCLM`: convolution against a continuous kernel, as a bounded linear map
  `Lp 𝕜 2 (haarProb G) →L[𝕜] C(G, 𝕜)`.
* `TauCeti.convolutionOperator`: the convolution operator `f ↦ k * f` on `Lp 𝕜 2 (haarProb G)`.

## Main statements

* `TauCeti.convolutionCLM_apply_apply`: the pointwise formula
  `(k * f) x = ∫ y, k (x * y⁻¹) * f y`.
* `TauCeti.convolutionCLM_toLp_apply`: the translated formula
  `(k * f) x = ∫ z, k z * f (z⁻¹ * x)` when `f` is continuous.
* `TauCeti.norm_convolutionCLM_apply_le`: `‖k * f‖_∞ ≤ ‖k‖_∞ * ‖f‖₂`, so convolution against a
  continuous kernel is bounded from `L²(G)` into the uniform norm of `C(G)`.
* `TauCeti.convolutionOperator_apply_eq_integral_leftRegularLp`: convolution is the strong
  integral of weighted left translations, including for infinite compact groups.
* `TauCeti.isSelfAdjoint_convolutionOperator`: a symmetric kernel gives a self-adjoint operator.
* `TauCeti.convolutionCLM_compMeasurePreserving_mul_right`: convolution commutes with right
  translation.
* `TauCeti.convolutionOperator_compMeasurePreserving_mul_left`: convolution against a central
  kernel commutes with left translation.
* `TauCeti.isCompactOperator_convolutionCLM` and `TauCeti.isCompactOperator_convolutionOperator`:
  convolution against a continuous kernel is a compact operator, into `C(G)` and into `L²(G)`.
* `TauCeti.finiteDimensional_eigenspace_convolutionOperator`: consequently the eigenspace of
  `convolutionOperator k` at a nonzero eigenvalue is finite-dimensional.
* `TauCeti.ae_eq_smul_convolutionCLM_of_mem_eigenspace`: an eigenvector at a nonzero eigenvalue is
  almost everywhere equal to the continuous function `μ⁻¹ • (k * f)`.
* `TauCeti.convolutionCLM_eq_zero_of_mem_eigenspace_zero`: an eigenvector at the eigenvalue `0`
  convolves to the zero function.
* `TauCeti.compMeasurePreserving_mul_right_mem_eigenspace_convolutionOperator`: the eigenspaces are
  invariant under right translation.
* `TauCeti.exists_hasEigenvalue_ne_zero_convolutionOperator`: a nonzero symmetric convolution
  operator has a nonzero eigenvalue, so such an eigenspace really exists.
* `TauCeti.orthogonalComplement_iSup_eigenspaces_convolutionOperator_eq_bot`: the eigenspaces of a
  symmetric convolution operator, at every eigenvalue, span a dense subspace of `L²(G)`.

## Implementation notes

Compactness is read off the same kernel sections, with no separate uniform-continuity argument:
the value `(k * f) x` is the `L²` pairing of `f` against the section at `x`, and the sections
depend continuously on `x` *in the uniform norm*, so the images of the unit ball are equicontinuous
by inspection. Arzelà-Ascoli (`BoundedContinuousFunction.arzela_ascoli`) then applies, in
`G →ᵇ 𝕜`, to which `C(G, 𝕜)` is isometric because `G` is compact.

Mathlib's `convolution` (`Mathlib/Analysis/Convolution.lean`) is the convolution of two functions
on an *additive* group against a bilinear pairing, and does not apply here: `G` is multiplicative,
and one of the two arguments is an `L²` class rather than a function. The kernel sections
`y ↦ conj (k (x * y⁻¹))` are assembled with `ContinuousMap.curry`, whose continuity is exactly the
statement that they depend continuously on `x`, so no uniform-continuity argument is needed.

Self-adjointness is proved by writing `convolutionOperator k H`, for a *continuous* `H`, as the
Bochner integral of the kernel sections weighted by `H`, and then extending to all of `L²(G)` by
density (`ContinuousMap.toLp_denseRange`). The more direct Fubini argument on `G × G` is not
available: the product of two Borel spaces is Borel only under a second-countability hypothesis,
which a compact group need not satisfy, whereas a continuous function on a compact space is
integrable with no such hypothesis (`TauCeti.integrable_continuousMap`).

The conjugation in the kernel sections is bookkeeping for Mathlib's convention that the inner
product is conjugate linear in its first argument; it is invisible in the pointwise formula
`convolutionCLM_apply_apply`.

## References

This is the opening of Layer 5 of the
[compact-groups roadmap](https://github.com/TauCetiProject/TauCetiRoadmap), which names
`convolutionOperator`, its self-adjointness for a symmetric kernel (there spelled
`convolutionOperator_isSelfAdjoint`, renamed here to `isSelfAdjoint_convolutionOperator` for the
predicate-prefix convention), its compactness (`convolutionOperator_isCompact`) and the finite
dimensionality of its nonzero eigenspaces (`convolutionOperator_eigenspace_finiteDimensional`) as
milestones on the non-circular route to the Peter-Weyl theorem.

/-! ### Self-adjointness for a symmetric kernel

For a *continuous* weight `H` the kernel sections may be averaged against `H`, giving a Bochner
integral in `C(G)` and, after `ContinuousMap.toLp`, one in `L²(G)`. Symmetry of the kernel
identifies that average with `k * H`, which is the adjoint relation on the dense subspace of
continuous functions; the general case follows because both sides of the relation are continuous in
their second argument. -/

/-! ### Compactness of the convolution operator

Convolution against a continuous kernel carries the closed unit ball of `L²(G)` to a family of
continuous functions bounded by `‖k‖` and equicontinuous: the increment of `k * f` between two
points is controlled by the distance between the corresponding kernel sections, uniformly in `f`.
The Arzelà-Ascoli theorem makes that family relatively compact in `C(G)`, hence in `L²(G)`. -/

Compactness bounds the dimension of each nonzero eigenspace; the pointwise formula shows every
eigenvector at a nonzero eigenvalue is a continuous function; and equivariance makes the
eigenspaces right-translation invariant. Together these are the three properties that turn a
symmetric convolution operator into a source of finite-dimensional representations of `G`. The
eigenspace at `0` is the complementary case: it convolves to nothing at all. -/

/-! ### The spectral consequences for a symmetric kernel

For a symmetric kernel the convolution operator is both compact and self-adjoint, so Mathlib's
spectral theory of compact self-adjoint operators applies to it. Two consequences matter for
Peter-Weyl: unless the operator vanishes it *has* a nonzero eigenvalue, and its eigenspaces
together span a dense subspace of `L²(G)`. -/

/-- **A nonzero symmetric convolution operator has a nonzero eigenvalue.** For a compact
self-adjoint operator the spectral radius is the operator norm and every nonzero spectral value is
an eigenvalue, so a nonzero operator cannot have `0` as its only eigenvalue.

This is where finite-dimensional representations of `G` come from: by the results above, the
eigenspace at such a `μ` is a nonzero, finite-dimensional, right-translation-invariant subspace of
`L²(G)` all of whose elements are continuous. No point-separation property of `G` is used, so
nothing is smuggled in from the Peter-Weyl theorem itself. -/
