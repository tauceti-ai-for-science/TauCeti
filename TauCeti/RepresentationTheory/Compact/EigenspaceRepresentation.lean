# The finite-dimensional representations carried by convolution eigenspaces

A compact group `G` acts on `L²(G)` by right translation, `(π g f) x = f (x * g)`
(`TauCeti.rightRegularLp`). This action is isometric and strongly continuous, but nothing makes
`g ↦ π g` continuous for the operator norm, so `L²(G)` itself does not come with the continuity
hypothesis that Mathlib's `ContRepresentation` is usually paired with. Restricted to an
eigenspace of a convolution operator at a nonzero eigenvalue it does: that eigenspace is
finite-dimensional, right-translation invariant, and made of continuous functions, all of which
`TauCeti.RepresentationTheory.Compact.Convolution` supplies.

This file assembles those three facts into the representation itself, and reads off the
consequence the Peter-Weyl theorem needs: the continuous representative `μ⁻¹ • (k * f)` of an
eigenvector `f` is the conjugate of a **matrix coefficient** of that representation, hence a
representative function, so it lies in the representative ring `𝓡(G)`. Since the eigenspaces of a
symmetric kernel span a dense subspace of `L²(G)` and convolution is bounded from `L²(G)` into the
uniform norm, *every* function of the form `k * f` lies in the uniform closure of `𝓡(G)`.

This is where the finite-dimensional representations of a compact group come from. Nothing here
presupposes that `G` has any: the representation is manufactured out of the spectral theory of a
compact self-adjoint operator, and no point-separation property is used, so the argument does not
quietly assume the theorem it serves.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.convolutionEigenspaceRepresentation`: the restriction of the right regular
  representation to an eigenspace of a convolution operator.

## Main statements

* `TauCeti.convolutionCLM_rightRegularLp`: convolution intertwines right translation on `L²(G)`
  with right translation of continuous functions.
* `TauCeti.continuous_convolutionEigenspaceRepresentation`: at a nonzero eigenvalue the eigenspace
  representation is continuous, so it is a genuine finite-dimensional continuous representation
  of `G`.
* `TauCeti.exists_smul_convolutionCLM_eq_star_matrixCoeff`: the continuous representative of an
  eigenvector at a nonzero eigenvalue is the conjugate of a matrix coefficient of that
  representation, at a vector independent of the eigenvector.
* `TauCeti.isRepresentative_smul_convolutionCLM_of_mem_eigenspace`: consequently it is a
  representative function.
* `TauCeti.convolutionCLM_mem_representativeSubmodule_of_mem_iSup_eigenspace`: convolving a finite
  sum of eigenvectors gives an element of the representative ring `𝓡(G)`.
* `TauCeti.convolutionCLM_mem_closure_representativeSubmodule`: for a symmetric kernel, `k * f`
  lies in the uniform closure of `𝓡(G)` for *every* `f ∈ L²(G)`.

## Implementation notes

Continuity of `g ↦ π g` on the eigenspace is checked pointwise, which is enough because the
eigenspace is finite-dimensional (`continuous_clm_apply`); pointwise it is the strong continuity
`TauCeti.continuous_rightRegularLp_apply` of the right regular representation, so no separate
argument about continuous representatives is needed.

The matrix coefficient is produced from the linear functional `h ↦ μ⁻¹ • (k * h) 1`, evaluation of
the continuous representative at the identity. Its Riesz vector `y` satisfies
`⟪y, π g f⟫ = μ⁻¹ • (k * f) g`, and Mathlib's inner product is conjugate linear in its first
argument, so what appears directly is the *conjugate* of the matrix coefficient
`g ↦ ⟪π g f, y⟫`. The representative functions are closed under conjugation
(`TauCeti.IsRepresentative.star`), so nothing is lost.

This is the `nonzero_eigenspace_finite_dim_continuous_rep` step of Layer 5 of the
[compact-groups roadmap](https://github.com/TauCetiProject/TauCetiRoadmap/blob/main/TauCetiRoadmap/RepresentationTheory/CompactGroups/README.md),
which asks for each nonzero eigenspace to be finite-dimensional and translation invariant, "so it
carries a continuous finite-dimensional representation whose functions lie in `𝓡(G)`". Combined
with an approximate identity it gives the uniform density of `𝓡(G)` in `C(G)`, the analytic core
of the Peter-Weyl theorem.

/-! ### The eigenvectors are representative functions -/

/-- **The continuous representative of an eigenvector is a matrix coefficient of the eigenspace
representation.** For a nonzero eigenvalue `μ`, one vector `y` of the eigenspace serves for every
eigenvector at once: it is the Riesz vector of the functional "evaluate the continuous
representative at the identity", and `μ⁻¹ • (k * f)` is the conjugate of the matrix coefficient at
`(f, y)`.

Naming the representation, rather than only the conclusion that the function is representative,
is what records that the finite-dimensional representations produced by the density argument are
*unitary* (`TauCeti.isUnitary_convolutionEigenspaceRepresentation`), so that a statement proved
for unitary representations can be fed back into it. -/

/-- **The continuous representative of an eigenvector is a representative function.** For a nonzero
eigenvalue `μ`, the continuous function `μ⁻¹ • (k * f)` representing an eigenvector `f` is the
conjugate of a matrix coefficient of `TauCeti.convolutionEigenspaceRepresentation`. At `μ = 0` the
function is `0`, which is representative for trivial reasons.

This is the point of the whole construction: at a nonzero eigenvalue the continuous representative
of an eigenvector is not merely continuous, it is a matrix coefficient of a finite-dimensional
continuous representation. At `μ = 0` the statement carries no information about `f` beyond
`TauCeti.convolutionCLM_eq_zero_of_mem_eigenspace_zero`, which is what makes it `0`. -/

/-- **Every convolution by a symmetric kernel lies in the uniform closure of the representative
ring.** The eigenspaces of a symmetric convolution operator span a dense subspace of `L²(G)`, each
of them convolves into `𝓡(G)`, and convolution is continuous from `L²(G)` into the uniform norm of
`C(G)`.

With an approximate identity, which lets a continuous function be uniformly approximated by such
convolutions, this gives the uniform density of `𝓡(G)` in `C(G)`, the analytic core of the
Peter-Weyl theorem. -/
