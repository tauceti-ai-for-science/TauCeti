# The Peter-Weyl theorem: the matrix coefficients are a Hilbert basis of `L²(G)`

Let `G` be a compact group. Schur orthogonality
(`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/Compact/Orthonormal.lean`) says that the normalized matrix
coefficients `√(dim V_i) · (π i)_{ab}` of a family of pairwise inequivalent finite-dimensional
irreducible unitary continuous representations form an *orthonormal system* in `L²(G)`. This file
proves that when the family is moreover **exhaustive** the system is *complete*, so it is a
**Hilbert basis** of `L²(G)`: the Peter-Weyl theorem. Hausdorffness is nowhere needed, here or
in the unconditional standard basis at the end: what the density argument runs on are the
mollifiers of `Compact/ApproximateIdentity.lean`, which are built without it.

## "One representative per equivalence class" is data

The index of the basis is not free. It hides a choice of model spaces, of unitary irreducible
representations on them, and of orthonormal bases; a theorem that merely asserts the existence of
such a family says nothing about which functions the basis consists of. Both are pinned here.

* `TauCeti.IrrepModel` is one chosen model: a natural number `dim`, a continuous unitary
  irreducible representation on the standard Hilbert space `EuclideanSpace 𝕜 (Fin dim)`, whose
  orthonormal basis is therefore `EuclideanSpace.basisFun`, not a further choice.
* `TauCeti.IsIrrepSkeleton models` says the family `models` is a skeleton of the unitary dual:
  pairwise inequivalent, and exhaustive in the sense that every continuous unitary irreducible
  representation on a standard model space is carried onto some `models i` by a linear isometry
  equivalence. Exhaustion is asked for in unitary form, which is no restriction: between
  irreducible unitary representations Schur's lemma makes every intertwining isomorphism a scalar
  multiple of an isometry (`ContRepresentation.exists_linearIsometryEquiv_congr_eq`).
* `TauCeti.peterWeylBasis` is a `HilbertBasis`, defined outright rather than existentially, and
  `TauCeti.coe_peterWeylBasis` identifies its elements as the normalized matrix coefficients
  `TauCeti.peterWeylFamily`. The element-level content is therefore available on the nose.

Nothing here is conditional on a skeleton being available: one is built at the end of the file.
Because a model's carrier is a standard space `EuclideanSpace 𝕜 (Fin n)`, unitary equivalence is
an equivalence relation on the *type* `TauCeti.IrrepModel 𝕜 G`, and choosing a representative in
each class gives `TauCeti.IrrepClass.model`, a skeleton by
`TauCeti.isIrrepSkeleton_model`. Feeding it to `TauCeti.peterWeylBasis` gives
`TauCeti.stdPeterWeylBasis`, a Hilbert basis of `L²(G)` for every compact `G` with no
hypothesis left over. Pairwise inequivalence of the representatives is the point where the
rescaling above is used.

## The completeness argument

Orthonormality is quoted from Schur. Completeness is what is proved here, and it factors through
the span `TauCeti.modelSubmodule` of the matrix coefficients of the models inside `C(G, 𝕜)`.

1. *Irreducible representations.* A continuous unitary irreducible representation on any
   finite-dimensional inner product space is carried to a standard model by
   `stdOrthonormalBasis`, hence onto some `models i` by exhaustion, and matrix coefficients are
   unchanged along an isometry (`LinearIsometryEquiv.matrixCoeff_congr`).
2. *Unitary representations.* An arbitrary continuous unitary representation splits as an
   orthogonal direct sum of irreducible subrepresentations
   (`ContRepresentation.IsUnitary.exists_orthogonal_irreducible_decomposition`), and for
   a vector `v` in one block the functional `⟪·, w⟫` only sees the orthogonal projection of `w`
   onto that block, so every matrix coefficient reduces to matrix coefficients of the blocks.
3. *Density.* The analytic core of Peter-Weyl
   (`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/Compact/RepresentativeDensity.lean`) approximates a continuous
   function by convolutions, and expands each convolution along the eigenspaces of the
   convolution operator. Those eigenspace representations are unitary
   (`TauCeti.isUnitary_convolutionEigenspaceRepresentation`), so step 2 applies to them and the
   *models'* coefficients are already uniformly dense: no unitarization of an arbitrary
   representation is needed anywhere.
4. *Passage to `L²`.* Continuous functions are dense in `L²` of a finite measure on a compact
   space, so the span of the models' coefficients is dense in `L²(G)` and its orthogonal
   complement vanishes, which is the hypothesis of `HilbertBasis.mkOfOrthogonalEqBot`.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.IrrepModel`, `TauCeti.IsIrrepSkeleton`: the chosen data and the exhaustion property.
* `TauCeti.modelSubmodule`: the span of the models' matrix coefficients in `C(G, 𝕜)`.
* `TauCeti.peterWeylFamily`: the normalized matrix coefficients, indexed by
  `Σ i, Fin (models i).dim × Fin (models i).dim`.
* `TauCeti.peterWeylBasis`: **the Peter-Weyl Hilbert basis of `L²(G)`.**
* `TauCeti.peterWeylCoeff`: the Fourier coefficient against a normalized matrix coefficient.
* `TauCeti.IrrepClass`, `TauCeti.IrrepClass.model`: the models up to unitary equivalence, and the
  representative chosen in each class.
* `TauCeti.stdPeterWeylBasis`: the Peter-Weyl basis of `L²(G)` on the chosen representatives, with
  no skeleton assumed.

## Main statements

* `TauCeti.IrrepModel.dim_pos`: a model has positive dimension, its carrier being nonzero.
* `TauCeti.IsIrrepSkeleton.matrixCoeff_mem`: every matrix coefficient of a finite-dimensional
  unitary continuous representation is a linear combination of the models' matrix coefficients.
* `TauCeti.IsIrrepSkeleton.dense_modelSubmodule`: those coefficients are uniformly dense in
  `C(G, 𝕜)`.
* `TauCeti.IsIrrepSkeleton.orthogonal_span_peterWeylFamily_eq_bot`: the completeness of the
  orthonormal system.
* `TauCeti.coe_peterWeylBasis`, `TauCeti.coe_stdPeterWeylBasis`: the basis is the normalized
  matrix coefficients.
* `TauCeti.peterWeylFamily_eq_toLp`: each family element is the `L²` class of its normalized
  continuous matrix coefficient.
* `TauCeti.coeFn_peterWeylFamily`: the almost-everywhere representative of a normalized matrix
  coefficient.
* `TauCeti.peterWeylBasis_repr_apply`, `TauCeti.stdPeterWeylBasis_repr_apply`: the abstract basis
  coordinates are the explicit Haar-integral Fourier coefficients.
* `TauCeti.hasSum_peterWeyl_expansion`: reconstruction of an `L²` function from its Peter-Weyl
  coefficients.
* `TauCeti.tsum_conj_peterWeylCoeff_mul_peterWeylCoeff`,
  `TauCeti.tsum_norm_sq_peterWeylCoeff`: polarized and norm-square Parseval identities.
* `TauCeti.isIrrepSkeleton_model`: the chosen representatives are a skeleton, so the hypothesis of
  `TauCeti.peterWeylBasis` is satisfiable and the theorem is not conditional.
