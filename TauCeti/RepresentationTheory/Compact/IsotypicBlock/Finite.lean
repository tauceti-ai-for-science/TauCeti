# For a finite group the Peter-Weyl block projections are the isotypic projectors

The algebraic identification of Peter-Weyl blocks with the isotypic components of the left
regular representation is proved for arbitrary compact groups in
`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/Compact/IsotypicBlock/Isotypic.lean`. This file additionally
identifies their character averaging operators with the bundled
`ContRepresentation.isotypicProjector` for finite discrete groups.

The bundled projector requires a norm-continuous representation on a finite-dimensional
carrier. Both conditions hold here: every map out of `G` is continuous, and `L²(G)` is the
space `G → 𝕜` of all functions on `G`, of dimension `|G|`
(`TauCeti.finiteDimensional_lp_haarProb`).

The bridge is that **convolution is the integrated operator of the left regular representation**,
`TauCeti.convolutionOperator_eq_integratedOperator_leftRegularLp`. Both operators are group averages
of the translates of their argument, and the identity is the substitution `y = g⁻¹x` in the
convolution integral, run as a reindexing of a finite sum. The *left* regular representation is the
one that appears, and not the right: left translation moves a matrix coefficient
`g ↦ ⟪π g v, w⟫` through its second vector `w`
(`ContRepresentation.matrixCoeff_comp_mulLeft`), on which it depends linearly, so the block
is a sum of copies of `π` itself under left translation, whereas right translation moves the first
vector, on which the coefficient depends conjugate-linearly.
This also matches the convolution computation of the block file, which moves the second vector by
the integrated operator of the kernel on the model's carrier.

Reading the averaging kernel `dim V_π · conj χ_π` as
`ContRepresentation.isotypicKernel` identifies the two operators
(`TauCeti.peterWeylBlockAveraging_eq_isotypicProjector`), and gives the range of the bundled
projector as the Peter-Weyl block (`TauCeti.toSubmodule_range_isotypicProjector_leftRegularLp`).

## Main results

* `TauCeti.convolutionOperator_eq_integratedOperator_leftRegularLp`: **on a finite discrete group,
  convolution against a kernel is the integrated operator of that kernel in the left regular
  representation.**
* `TauCeti.peterWeylBlockAveraging_eq_isotypicProjector`: **the character averaging operator of a
  block is the isotypic projector of the model in the left regular representation.**
* `TauCeti.toSubmodule_range_isotypicProjector_leftRegularLp`: **the range of the bundled
  isotypic projector is the Peter-Weyl block**, for a skeleton of the unitary dual over an
  algebraically closed `𝕜`.

/-- **Convolution is the integrated operator of the left regular representation**, for a finite
discrete group.

Both sides average the translates `x ↦ f (g⁻¹ * x)` of `f` against the kernel: the integrated
operator does so visibly, and for convolution it is the substitution `y = g⁻¹ * x` in
`TauCeti.convolutionCLM_apply_apply`, which on a finite group is a reindexing of the sum along the
bijection `g ↦ g⁻¹ * x`.

Nothing of the sort holds for a general compact group, not because the identity fails but because
its right-hand side is not available: `TauCeti.ContRepresentation.integratedOperator` asks for a
norm-continuous representation, and the regular representation of an infinite compact group on
`L²(G)` is only strongly continuous. -/
