# Dominant weights for the general linear group

The irreducible rational representations of `GL n` are indexed by the weakly decreasing integer
sequences `λ₁ ≥ ⋯ ≥ λₙ`, the **dominant weights** of the diagonal torus.  This file builds that
index type and its dictionary with Young diagrams, before any representation is attached to a
weight: the combinatorics is exactly the bookkeeping that separates the *polynomial*
representations from the general *rational* ones.

Two facts organize the file.  First, the dominant weights with nonnegative entries — the
`TauCeti.DominantWeight.IsPolynomial` ones — are precisely the Young diagrams with at most `n`
rows, an equivalence `TauCeti.shapeEquivPolynomialWeight`.  Second, every dominant weight is a
**determinant twist** of a polynomial one: writing `m = λₙ` for its last entry
(`TauCeti.DominantWeight.detShift`) and subtracting it leaves a weight with nonnegative entries
whose own last entry vanishes, so its Young diagram `TauCeti.DominantWeight.detShiftShape` has at
most `n - 1` rows, and `λ` is recovered from that diagram by shifting back by `m`.  The vanishing
last entry is what makes the pair `(m, μ)` unique: without the row bound the same `λ` is
`μ + m·(1, …, 1)` for many pairs.  Downstream this is the statement that a rational irreducible
is `det^m` tensored with a polynomial one.

A third fact ties the weights to the symmetric group acting on `ℤⁿ` by permuting coordinates:
every orbit of that action contains exactly one dominant weight
(`TauCeti.existsUnique_dominantWeight`), the weakly decreasing rearrangement
`TauCeti.dominantWeightOf` of any of its members.  So a dominant weight is the canonical
representative of its orbit; that these representatives index the irreducibles of `GL n` is the
highest-weight classification, which is not proved here.

The last entry `λₙ` is read through the dedicated accessor `TauCeti.DominantWeight.detShift`,
which is `0` for `n = 0`, so that the empty weight needs no special casing at the use sites.
Being an accessor rather than a shift, it is compatible with `TauCeti.DominantWeight.shift` only
for a nonempty weight (`TauCeti.DominantWeight.detShift_shift`).

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.DominantWeight`: the weakly decreasing sequences `Fin n → ℤ`.
* `TauCeti.DominantWeight.shift`: translating a weight by an integer multiple of `(1, …, 1)`.
* `TauCeti.DominantWeight.detShift`: the last entry `λₙ`, the determinant-twist exponent.
* `TauCeti.DominantWeight.IsPolynomial`: having nonnegative entries.
* `TauCeti.DominantWeight.shape` and `TauCeti.weightOfShape`: the two directions of the
  dictionary between weights and Young diagrams.
* `TauCeti.DominantWeight.detShiftShape`: the Young diagram of the polynomial part `λ - λₙ`.
* `TauCeti.dominantSort` and `TauCeti.dominantWeightOf`: the permutation sorting an arbitrary
  weight into weakly decreasing order, and the dominant weight it produces.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.DominantWeight.isPolynomial_iff_zero_le_detShift`: a weight is polynomial as soon as
  its last entry is nonnegative.
* `TauCeti.shapeEquivPolynomialWeight`: the Young diagrams with at most `n` rows are the
  polynomial dominant weights of `GL n`.
* `TauCeti.DominantWeight.shift_weightOfShape_detShiftShape`: the determinant twist
  `λ = μ + λₙ·(1, …, 1)` with `μ = detShiftShape λ`, together with
  `TauCeti.DominantWeight.colLen_zero_detShiftShape_le_pred`, which bounds `μ` by `n - 1` rows.
* `TauCeti.DominantWeight.eq_detShift_and_eq_detShiftShape`: that decomposition is the only one
  whose diagram has at most `n - 1` rows.
* `TauCeti.DominantWeight.detShiftShape_eq_detShiftShape_iff`: the polynomial part is a complete
  invariant of a weight modulo the constant weights, and
  `TauCeti.DominantWeight.detShiftShape_weightOfShape` shows every diagram with at most `n - 1`
  rows occurs as one.
* `TauCeti.existsUnique_dominantWeight`: each orbit of the symmetric group permuting the
  coordinates of `ℤⁿ` contains exactly one dominant weight.
