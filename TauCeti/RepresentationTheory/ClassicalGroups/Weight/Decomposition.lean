# The weight-space decomposition of a rational representation

A rational representation of `GL n ℂ` is the internal direct sum of its weight spaces: the
diagonal torus is simultaneously diagonalizable on it, and every joint eigencharacter occurring in
it is among the monomial characters `t ↦ ∏ i, tᵢ ^ lᵢ` of the torus. Which of those characters
actually occur — equivalently, which weight spaces are nonzero — is not determined here; the
decomposition is indexed by all of `Fin n → ℤ`. This file proves that
(`TauCeti.IsRationalRep.isInternal_weightSpace`), completing the decomposition that
`TauCeti.RepresentationTheory.ClassicalGroups.Weight.Basic` establishes only for the standard
representation.

Rationality is what carries the argument, and it cannot be dropped: an abstract representation of
the torus `(ℂˣ)ⁿ` on a finite-dimensional space need not be diagonalizable at all, and even a
diagonalizable one has joint eigencharacters that are arbitrary homomorphisms `(ℂˣ)ⁿ → ℂˣ`,
almost none of which is a monomial `t ↦ ∏ tᵢ ^ lᵢ`. Rationality forces both.

The proof is the **Laurent expansion** of the torus action. Restricted along `TauCeti.diagGL`, the
matrix entries of `ρ` are Laurent functions on the torus
(`TauCeti.comp_diagGL_mem_laurentFunctions`), so `ρ (diagGL t)` is a finite sum
`∑_l (∏ i, tᵢ ^ lᵢ) • A l` with coefficients `A l` in `Module.End ℂ W` that do not depend on `t`
(`TauCeti.IsRationalRep.exists_forall_diagGL_eq_sum_smul`). Comparing the expansion of
`ρ (diagGL (s * t))` with that of `ρ (diagGL s) ∘ ρ (diagGL t)` and using the linear independence
of distinct characters
(`TauCeti.linearIndependent_weightCharHom`) identifies the coefficients term by term: `ρ (diagGL s)`
acts on the image of `A l` by the character of `l`, so that image lies in the weight space of `l`
(`TauCeti.apply_mem_weightSpace_of_forall_diagGL_eq_sum_smul`). Evaluating the expansion at `t = 1`
writes the identity as `∑_l A l`, so every vector is a sum of weight vectors.

The tensor, symmetric and exterior powers of the standard representation are polynomial
(`TauCeti.isPolynomialRep_tensorPowerRep` and its companions), hence rational
(`TauCeti.IsPolynomialRep.isRationalRep`), so their decompositions are instances of the theorem
below and are not restated as separate declarations.

The pinned roadmap signature carries `[FiniteDimensional ℂ W]` as well. It is dropped here: it is
implied by `TauCeti.IsRationalRep.finite`, and an unused hypothesis on the statement would be both
weaker and flagged by the linter.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.IsRationalRep.exists_forall_diagGL_eq_sum_smul`: the Laurent expansion of a rational
  representation on the diagonal torus.
* `TauCeti.apply_mem_weightSpace_of_forall_diagGL_eq_sum_smul`: the coefficients of such an
  expansion take their values in the weight space of their exponent. This step mentions no
  rationality, so it is stated over an arbitrary infinite field; only the three results whose
  hypothesis is the `ℂ`-pinned `TauCeti.IsRationalRep` are stated over `ℂ`.
* `TauCeti.IsRationalRep.iSup_weightSpace_eq_top` and
  `TauCeti.IsRationalRep.isInternal_weightSpace`: **a rational representation of `GL n ℂ` is the
  internal direct sum of its weight spaces.**
* `TauCeti.IsRationalRep.exists_weightSpace_ne_bot`: a nonzero rational representation has a
  weight.
* `TauCeti.finite_setOf_weightSpace_ne_bot`: a finite-dimensional representation has only finitely
  many weights. This reads off the independence of the weight spaces alone, so it needs neither
  rationality nor an infinite field.

torus acts through a finite sum `∑ l ∈ S, (∏ i, tᵢ ^ lᵢ) • A l`, then every value of `A l` is a
weight vector of weight `l`. Nothing is claimed here about `A l` being idempotent, or acting as
the identity on the weight space of `l`; only its image is located.

Nothing in this statement refers to rationality, so the base field is an arbitrary infinite field:
the argument only needs distinct characters of the torus to stay linearly independent. -/

occur — that is, for which `l` the summand is nonzero — is not part of the statement. The roadmap
