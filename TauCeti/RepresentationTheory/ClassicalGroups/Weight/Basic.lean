# Weights of the diagonal torus of the general linear group

A vector `w` of a representation `ρ` of `GL n k` has **weight** `l : Fin n → ℤ` when every
invertible diagonal matrix `diagGL t` scales it by `∏ i, tᵢ ^ lᵢ`. The vectors of weight `l` form
the **weight space** `TauCeti.weightSpace ρ l`, and this file builds that space and the two facts
that make weights a decomposition rather than a labelling: the weight spaces are independent, and
the standard representation is the internal direct sum of its weight spaces, which are its
coordinate lines.

The scalar `∏ i, tᵢ ^ lᵢ` is the split-torus character `TauCeti.weightChar k l`, built in
`TauCeti.LinearAlgebra.Basis.DiagonalTorus.Basic`. The weight space is an intersection of
eigenspaces, one for each point of the torus, so independence is that of the joint eigenspaces of a
representation indexed by characters — `TauCeti.iSupIndep_iInf_eigenspace_unitHom` — transported
along `l ↦ TauCeti.weightChar k l`. That transport needs the map to be injective, and that is
where the coefficients enter: over `𝔽₂` the torus is trivial
(`TauCeti.diagonalTorus_eq_bot`), every `l` gives the same character, and the whole module is a
weight space for every weight at once, so nothing is independent. Rather than fix the coefficients,
every statement below that separates weights takes `Function.Injective (weightChar k)` as a
hypothesis. `TauCeti.weightChar_injective` discharges it over an infinite field, and
`TauCeti.weightChar_injective_of_algebraRat` over a field that is a `ℚ`-algebra.

The definitions themselves need only a commutative ring, and are stated there.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.weightSpace`: the space of vectors on which the diagonal torus acts through
  `TauCeti.weightChar`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.iSupIndep_weightSpace`: **the weight spaces of a representation of `GL n k` are
  independent**, as soon as distinct weights give distinct characters.
* `TauCeti.weightSpace_stdRep_single` and `TauCeti.weightSpace_stdRep_eq_bot`: the weight spaces of
  the standard representation are exactly its coordinate lines, the line `k ∙ eᵢ` carrying the
  weight `Pi.single i 1` and every other weight space vanishing.
* `TauCeti.isInternal_weightSpace_of_iSup_eq_top`: **a representation whose weight spaces span it
  is their internal direct sum**, as soon as distinct weights give distinct characters.
* `TauCeti.isInternal_weightSpace_stdRep`: **the standard representation is the internal direct sum
  of its weight spaces.**
* `TauCeti.weightSpace_detPowerRep`: all of `det ^ m` has the constant weight `m`, that is, its
  weight space at the constant sequence `m` is `⊤`. Over a general commutative ring this says
  nothing about the other weight spaces — over `𝔽₂` all of them are `⊤` as well.
* `TauCeti.map_weightSpace_le_of_commute`: **an operator commuting with the torus action preserves
  every weight space**, so when the ambient representation is the internal direct sum of its weight
  spaces, a subrepresentation the operator cuts out inherits that decomposition.
* `Subrepresentation.weightSpace_toRepresentation`: **the weight spaces of a
  subrepresentation are the traces of the ambient ones**, with
  `Subrepresentation.weightSpace_toRepresentation_eq_bot_iff` giving the criterion for a weight
  not to occur in the subrepresentation.

## Implementation notes

The weight space is indexed by `l : Fin n → ℤ`, not by a character of the torus, because that is
the index the highest-weight theory of the roadmap runs on; `TauCeti.weightChar` is the translation
between the two, and the separation hypothesis says the translation is faithful.

The intersection defining `TauCeti.weightSpace` runs over `t : Fin n → kˣ` rather than over
`TauCeti.diagonalTorus k n` itself: `TauCeti.diagGL` is onto the torus
(`TauCeti.mem_diagonalTorus_iff_exists_diagGL`), so the two conditions agree, and the
coordinatewise form is the one every computation below uses.

Weight spaces are intersections of honest eigenspaces, not of generalised ones: a torus element
acts on a weight vector by an honest scalar, and independence is available in that form already.

The operator therefore acts on each weight space separately, which is how a subrepresentation cut
out of `W` by such an operator inherits a weight decomposition of `W` — when `W` has one, that is;
the statement itself says nothing about whether the weight spaces of `W` span it or are
independent. -/
