# The standard representation of S₃ in characteristic three

In characteristic three, the constant vectors belong to the two-dimensional standard
representation of S₃. The quotient by this trivial line is the sign representation.
The maps below give the resulting exact sequence explicitly: the inclusion sends a scalar
to the constant vector, and the quotient map takes the difference of coordinates zero and one.
Over a field, this sequence determines the composition factors. Over any nontrivial
coefficient ring of characteristic three, it has no equivariant section.
