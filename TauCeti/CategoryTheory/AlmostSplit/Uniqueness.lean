# Uniqueness of the almost-split sequence at a given end

An almost-split sequence `0 ⟶ A ⟶ B ⟶ C ⟶ 0` whose left-hand end has **local** endomorphism ring
is determined by its right-hand end `C`: two such almost-split sequences with isomorphic
right-hand ends are isomorphic as short complexes, so in particular their left-hand ends and their
middle terms are isomorphic.  This file proves that, the uniqueness half of the Auslander-Reiten
theorem, and proves it in the sharper form that *every* morphism between two such almost-split
sequences that is invertible at the right-hand end is invertible.  Concretely, every uniqueness
statement comparing two sequences carries `[IsLocalRing (End S.X₁)]` together with
`[IsLocalRing (End S'.X₁)]` for
the second sequence, in a preadditive and balanced ambient category; none of these conclusions is
claimed for an arbitrary almost-split sequence in an arbitrary preadditive category.  Only the
comparison morphism `CategoryTheory.ShortComplex.IsAlmostSplit.exists_hom_τ₃_eq`, which produces a
morphism and asserts nothing about its invertibility, is free of the locality hypotheses.

Two inputs beyond the definition are therefore needed, and both are hypotheses rather than ambient
assumptions.  The category is asked to be preadditive and balanced, which is what makes the
left-hand end of a short exact sequence a kernel of its second map (`ShortComplex.Exact.lift'`
is stated only for a balanced category) and lets a morphism that is both monic and epic be
inverted.  And the endomorphism ring of each left-hand end is asked to be **local**, the
Krull-Schmidt input.  An almost-split sequence does have an indecomposable left-hand end
(`TauCeti.IsLeftAlmostSplit.indecomposable`), but indecomposability in a general preadditive
category does not give locality.  What it gives, once idempotents split — over an
idempotent-complete category with binary biproducts, for instance any abelian one — is that the
object is nonzero and has no idempotent endomorphism other than `0` and the identity
(`TauCeti.indecomposable_iff_idempotent_eq_zero_or_id`), and that is strictly weaker: a ring whose
only idempotents are `0` and `1` need not be local.  Indecomposability becomes *equivalent* to
locality of the endomorphism ring for a module of **finite length** — in particular for a
finite-dimensional module over a finite-dimensional algebra — which is Fitting's lemma, available
here for objects of `ModuleCat A` as `TauCeti.indecomposable_iff_isLocalRing_end`; that is how a use
site over such an algebra discharges the hypothesis.

The rigidity and comparison lemmas need only one half of the almost-split condition, so they
are stated in `TauCeti.IsLeftAlmostSplit` or `TauCeti.IsRightAlmostSplit`; the results about an
almost-split sequence are their corollaries. The rigidity lemmas fixing the right-hand end assume
exactness, monicity of the first map, and locality of the left-hand endomorphism ring. Their duals
fixing the left-hand end assume exactness, epicity of the second map, and
`[IsLocalRing (End S.X₃)]`. Both `TauCeti.IsLeftAlmostSplit.isIso_of_τ₃_eq_id` and
`TauCeti.IsRightAlmostSplit.isIso_of_τ₁_eq_id` ask for full short exactness for their five-lemma
steps. These rigidity results also feed the minimality results in
`TauCeti.CategoryTheory.AlmostSplit.Minimal`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.IsLeftAlmostSplit.isIso_τ₁_of_τ₃_eq_id`: **an endomorphism of an exact short complex
  with monic, left almost split first map that is the identity on the right-hand end is an
  isomorphism on the left-hand end**, and `TauCeti.IsLeftAlmostSplit.isIso_of_τ₃_eq_id`: it is then
  an isomorphism of short complexes.  This is the engine of the file.
* `TauCeti.IsRightAlmostSplit.isIso_τ₃_of_τ₁_eq_id`: an endomorphism of an exact short complex
  with epic, right almost split second map and local right-hand endomorphism ring that fixes the
  left-hand end is invertible on the right-hand end. Its short exact version,
  `TauCeti.IsRightAlmostSplit.isIso_of_τ₁_eq_id`, is an isomorphism of short complexes.
* `TauCeti.IsRightAlmostSplit.exists_hom_τ₃_eq_of_not_isSplitEpi`: **the comparison morphism.** A
  map into the right-hand end of an exact short complex with monic first map and right almost split
  second map, whose composite with the first sequence's `g` is not a split epimorphism, is the third
  component of a morphism of short complexes;
  `CategoryTheory.ShortComplex.IsAlmostSplit.exists_hom_τ₃_eq` is the case of an isomorphism
  between the right-hand ends of two almost-split sequences.
* `CategoryTheory.ShortComplex.IsAlmostSplit.isIso_of_isIso_τ₃`: **a morphism between two
  almost-split sequences with local left-hand endomorphism rings that is invertible at the
  right-hand end is invertible**, the sharp form of uniqueness.
* `CategoryTheory.ShortComplex.IsAlmostSplit.exists_iso_τ₃_eq`: **uniqueness.** An isomorphism
  between the right-hand ends of two almost-split sequences with local left-hand endomorphism rings
  is realized by an isomorphism of the sequences, so such a sequence is unique *under* its
  right-hand end; the plainer statement is
  `CategoryTheory.ShortComplex.IsAlmostSplit.nonempty_iso`, with
  `CategoryTheory.ShortComplex.IsAlmostSplit.nonempty_iso_X₁` and `.nonempty_iso_X₂` the
  statements about the left-hand ends and the middle terms that the Auslander-Reiten theorem is
  usually quoted in.
