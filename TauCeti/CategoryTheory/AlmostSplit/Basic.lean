# Right and left almost split morphisms

A morphism `f : X ⟶ Y` is **right almost split** when it is not a split epimorphism and *every*
morphism `Z ⟶ Y` that is not a split epimorphism factors through it. Dually `f` is **left almost
split** when it is not a split monomorphism and every morphism `X ⟶ Z` that is not a split
monomorphism factors through it. So a right almost split morphism into `Y` is a single map that
absorbs all the "inessential" maps into `Y` at once, and a left almost split morphism out of `X`
absorbs all the inessential maps out of `X`.

These are the two lifting properties an **almost-split (Auslander-Reiten) sequence**
`0 → τM → E → M → 0` carries: `E ⟶ M` is right almost split and `τM ⟶ E` is left almost split.
This file builds them as conditions on a single morphism of an arbitrary category, so that the
sequence-level notion can be assembled from them — it is, as
`CategoryTheory.ShortComplex.IsAlmostSplit` in `TauCeti/CategoryTheory/AlmostSplit/Sequence.lean` —
and proves the two facts that make the indecomposability clauses in the definition of an
almost-split sequence redundant: **the target of a right almost split morphism is indecomposable**,
and dually **the source of a left almost split morphism is indecomposable**. Neither end of an
almost-split sequence has to be *assumed* indecomposable — the lifting properties already force
it.

The connection to `TauCeti.IsIrreducibleMorphism` is the sharpened factorization
`TauCeti.IsRightAlmostSplit.exists_isSplitMono_of_isIrreducibleMorphism`: an irreducible morphism
into `Y` not only factors through a right almost split `f : X ⟶ Y`, it factors through it by a
**split monomorphism**, exhibiting its source as a retract of `X`. This is what makes the middle
term of an almost-split sequence the receptacle of the irreducible morphisms into `M`, and hence
what ties the sequence to the arrows of the Auslander-Reiten quiver.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.IsRightAlmostSplit` and `TauCeti.IsLeftAlmostSplit`: the definitions, with
  `TauCeti.isRightAlmostSplit_iff` and `TauCeti.isLeftAlmostSplit_iff` as the introduction rules
  and the projections `not_isSplitEpi` / `not_isSplitMono` and `factors`.
* `TauCeti.isRightAlmostSplit_op_iff` and `TauCeti.isLeftAlmostSplit_op_iff`: **the two notions are
  exchanged by passage to the opposite category**, so every result about one transports to the
  other.
* `TauCeti.IsRightAlmostSplit.indecomposable`: **the target of a right almost split morphism is
  indecomposable**, and `TauCeti.IsLeftAlmostSplit.indecomposable`: the source of a left almost
  split morphism is indecomposable.
* `TauCeti.IsRightAlmostSplit.exists_isSplitMono_of_isIrreducibleMorphism` and
  `TauCeti.IsLeftAlmostSplit.exists_isSplitEpi_of_isIrreducibleMorphism`: **an irreducible
  morphism factors through an almost split morphism by a split mono, resp. a split epi.**
* `TauCeti.IsRightAlmostSplit.epi_of_epi` and `TauCeti.IsLeftAlmostSplit.mono_of_mono`: a right
  almost split morphism is an epimorphism as soon as *some* non-split-epi into its target is one.
* `TauCeti.IsRightAlmostSplit.not_projective` and `TauCeti.IsLeftAlmostSplit.not_injective`: **the
  target of an epimorphic right almost split morphism is not projective**, and dually the source of
  a monomorphic left almost split morphism is not injective.
* `TauCeti.IsRightAlmostSplit.not_isSplitMono`, `.not_mono` and `.ne_zero` and their left-hand
  duals: **an epimorphic right almost split morphism is neither a split monomorphism nor — in a
  balanced category — a monomorphism, and it is nonzero.**
* Invariance under isomorphisms of the source and the target,
  `TauCeti.isRightAlmostSplit_comp_iso_iff`, `TauCeti.isRightAlmostSplit_iso_comp_iff` and their
  left-hand analogues, so the notions descend to a skeleton.

## Implementation notes

The definitions are conjunctions rather than structures, matching the shape of
`TauCeti.IsIrreducibleMorphism`; their bodies are not exposed outside this module, so
`TauCeti.isRightAlmostSplit_iff` and `TauCeti.isLeftAlmostSplit_iff` are the introduction rules.

Both predicates are stated for `f : X ⟶ Y` in the same category, the right-hand notion being a
condition at the target `Y` and the left-hand one a condition at the source `X`. The lifting
quantifiers range over *all* objects of the ambient category. For the Auslander-Reiten theory of a
finite-dimensional algebra that is the intended reading: the ambient category there is the
finite-dimensional one, as it already is for `TauCeti.IsIrreducibleMorphism`. The distinction is
not cosmetic — quantifying an almost-split sequence's lifting properties over a category of
representations with no finiteness restriction states a strictly stronger condition, and the
existence theorem for such sequences is false in that form (Paquette, *A non-existence theorem for
almost split sequences*, arXiv:1104.1195, exhibits infinite-dimensional indecomposable
representations of the Kronecker quiver that end no almost-split sequence). Instantiating `C` at
the finite-dimensional subcategory is what recovers the intended notion.

A right almost split morphism may well be zero: over a field, the map `0 ⟶ k` is right almost
split, every non-split-epi into the simple projective `k` being zero. So there is no unconditional
analogue here of `TauCeti.IsIrreducibleMorphism.ne_zero`, and this is not an oversight — it is the
boundary case of a projective target, where the almost split morphism is the inclusion of the
radical. `TauCeti.IsRightAlmostSplit.ne_zero` therefore assumes `[Epi f]`, which is exactly what
that boundary case fails.

Indecomposability of the target is proved directly from the definition rather than through
endomorphism rings, so it needs no additivity, no finiteness and no field: given `Y ≅ A ⊞ B` with
both summands nonzero, neither inclusion `A ⟶ Y` nor `B ⟶ Y` is a split epimorphism (a section of
one of them retracts `A ⊞ B` onto that summand along its inclusion, and the two complementary
structure maps then compose to `0`, collapsing the other summand), so both factor through `f`, and
`CategoryTheory.Limits.biprod.desc` assembles the two factorizations into a section of `f`.

/-- **A right almost split morphism**: one that is not a split epimorphism, and through which
every morphism to its target that is not a split epimorphism factors.

The negative clause is what makes the notion nonvacuous: without it every split epimorphism would
qualify, the identity among them. With it, a right almost split morphism is in particular not an
isomorphism (`TauCeti.IsRightAlmostSplit.not_isIso`) and its target is indecomposable
(`TauCeti.IsRightAlmostSplit.indecomposable`). -/

/-- **A left almost split morphism**: one that is not a split monomorphism, and through which
every morphism out of its source that is not a split monomorphism factors. This is the condition
