# Graded linear quivers

A *graded linear quiver* over a commutative ring `R` is a collection of objects such that every
ordered pair of objects carries an `R`-module of morphisms with an internal `ℤ`-grading.  That is
the whole of the data: there is no composition, no identity, and no law relating the morphisms of
different pairs of objects.

The higher theories of this library are built on such a quiver rather than assumed in it.  A
differential graded category is a graded linear quiver together with a graded composition and
identities which are unital and associative, and an `A∞` category is a graded linear quiver
together with operations `mₙ` of degree `2 - n` in arity `n` for `n ≥ 1`.  Composition is the
operation `m₂` of that structure and not a datum of the quiver, so a differential graded category
is the subcase of an `A∞` category in which `m₂` is a strictly unital and strictly
associative composition and the operations `mₙ` vanish for `n ≥ 3`.  The differential is part
of that structure rather than of the quiver as well: it is the degree-one operation `d = m₁`,
and a differential graded category requires that it square to zero and be a graded derivation of
the composition, `d (f ∘ g) = d f ∘ g + (-1)^{|f|} f ∘ d g` for morphisms `f` and `g` of
degrees `|f|` and `|g|`.

The grading is internal: the morphisms of degree `n` are the submodule `grHom X Y n` of the hom
module `X → Y`, and the submodule family is an internal direct sum, so every morphism is a finite
and uniquely determined sum of morphisms of definite degrees, its degree-`n` component being
`DirectSum.decompose` of the grading, as in `TauCeti.InternalGrading`.  The same data is a
`CategoryTheory.GradedObject ℤ (ModuleCat R)`, which presents the homogeneous modules separately,
through `TauCeti.GradedLinearQuiver.gradedHom` and the constructor
`TauCeti.GradedLinearQuiver.ofGradedHom`;
`TauCeti.InternalGrading.toGradedObject` and `TauCeti.InternalGrading.ofGradedObject` convert
between the two presentations, and `TauCeti.InternalGrading.ofGradedObjectToGradedObjectIso`
recovers the components `F X Y` of `ofGradedHom F` from its grading, degree by degree.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.GradedLinearQuiver`: a graded linear quiver over a commutative ring.
* `TauCeti.GradedLinearQuiver.ofGradedHom`: the graded linear quiver of a graded object of hom
  modules.
* `TauCeti.GradedLinearQuiver.grHom`: the morphisms `X → Y` of a fixed degree.
* `TauCeti.GradedLinearQuiver.gradedHom`: the hom modules of a graded linear quiver as a graded
  object.
* `TauCeti.GradedLinearQuiver.grHomReindex`: a homogeneous morphism recorded at another degree.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.GradedLinearQuiver.homModule_ofGradedHom`: the hom module of `ofGradedHom F`, the
  external direct sum of the components of `F X Y`.
* `TauCeti.GradedLinearQuiver.grading_ofGradedHom`: the internal grading of that hom module, the
  canonical grading of the external direct sum of the components of `F X Y`.
* `TauCeti.GradedLinearQuiver.grHomReindex_refl` and
  `TauCeti.GradedLinearQuiver.grHomReindex_trans`: a homogeneous morphism reindexed by an equation
  of degrees is the morphism itself, recorded at the new degree, and successive reindexings compose.

/-- A **graded linear quiver** over a commutative ring `R`: a collection of objects `C` with, for
each ordered pair of objects, an `R`-module `homModule X Y` of morphisms carrying an internal `ℤ`
grading `grading X Y`.

There is no composition and no identity, and no law relating the data of different pairs of
objects: they belong to the structure which a graded linear quiver carries, such as the `A∞`
structure whose operation `m₂` is the composition.

The base ring is a commutative ring, as for the differential graded categories of `TauCeti`. -/

A graded linear quiver with two objects, carrying a copy of `R` in each of the degrees `0` and `1`
and no morphism in any other degree.  The same graded object of components is assigned to every
ordered pair of objects, so the total hom module of such a pair is the external direct sum
`⨁ p, twoObjModule R p`.  The ring of the example is taken in the universe of the hom modules,
so that a copy of `R` is one of their components. -/
