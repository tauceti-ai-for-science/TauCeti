# Invertible multiplication by a natural number

In a preadditive category, multiplication by a natural number `d` on an object `X` is the
morphism `d • 𝟙 X`. This file records two facts about it when it is invertible:

* `CategoryTheory.Preadditive.comp_inv_nsmul_id`: the inverse of multiplication by `d` commutes
  with every morphism.
* `CategoryTheory.Functor.isIso_nsmul_id_obj`: an additive functor keeps multiplication by `d`
  invertible.
