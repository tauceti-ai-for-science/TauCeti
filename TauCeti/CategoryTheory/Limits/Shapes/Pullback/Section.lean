# Base change of the second factor of a pullback, and sections

Fix `π : Y ⟶ S`. A morphism `k : T' ⟶ T` with `k ≫ a = a'` induces the base-change morphism

```
pullback.mapSnd π a a' k hk : pullback π a' ⟶ pullback π a
```

which is the identity on the first factor `Y` and `k` on the second. A lift `s : T ⟶ Y` of
`a : T ⟶ S` through `π` induces a section `pullbackSection π a s hs : T ⟶ pullback π a` of the
second projection `pullback.snd π a`, with first projection `s`.

When `s = a ≫ σ` for a section `σ` of `π`, `pullbackSection π a s hs` is the section underlying
`CategoryTheory.SplitEpi.pullback`.

## Main definitions

* `CategoryTheory.Limits.pullback.mapSnd`: the morphism `pullback π a' ⟶ pullback π a` induced
  by a morphism `k : T' ⟶ T` over `S`.
* `CategoryTheory.Limits.pullbackSection`: the section of `pullback.snd π a` induced by a lift of
  `a` through `π`.

## Main results

* `CategoryTheory.Limits.pullback.mapSnd_id` and `CategoryTheory.Limits.pullback.mapSnd_comp`:
  `pullback.mapSnd` preserves identities and composition.
* `CategoryTheory.Limits.pullback.isKernelPair_mapSnd`: base change of the second factor along
  the two projections `T ×_S T ⟶ T` is the kernel pair of `pullback.fst π p : Y ×_S T ⟶ Y`.
* `CategoryTheory.Limits.pullbackSection_comp_mapSnd`: `pullbackSection` is natural across
  `pullback.mapSnd`.

## Provenance

`pullback.mapSnd`, `pullbackSection` and their lemmas generalise declarations of AINTLIB
(`github.com/CBirkbeck/AINTLIB`, Apache-2.0) at commit `c3415f32a313e19ace43e05479aeaa0d56ca287a`,
file `projects/ModularCurves/ModularCurves/Picard/RelativePic.lean`:
`AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Modules.baseChangeMap`, `baseChangeMap_id`, `baseChangeMap_comp`,
`baseChangeZero`, `baseChangeZero_snd`, and `baseChangeZero_baseChangeMap`. There the category is
that of schemes and the section is induced by a section of `π`; here the category is arbitrary
and the section is induced by any lift of `a` through `π`.
